</p>
    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p> With the installation of a PDP 11/70 minicomputer in 1981 for
      use in seismic network analysis, a persistent effort was made to
      use that tool for research. Because of the uniqueness of a
      dedicated minicimputer for research at that time as well as a
      desire to do something for the world wide seismological community,
      a set of documented computer programs emerged. The programs
      developed actually reflect research interests of the department as
      well as a desire to look at data in the manner of other
      investigators. In doing so, the hope is that these tools will
      permit research to progress rapidly. </p>
    <p>This programming effort led to the development of COMPUTER
      PROGRAMS IN SEISMOLOGY which continues to be distributed. The
      package contains its own graphics package, and is relatively easy
      to install. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Version 2.0 emphasized the development of algorithms. </li>
      <li>Version 3.0 (NEW) emphasizes ease of use. <font
          color="#ff0000">Version 3.30</font> is the latest release. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Computer Programs in Seismology</h2>
    <p> These programs focus on the understanding and interpretation of
      seismic wave propagation in the crust and upper mantle of the
      Earth. Synthetic seismograph code is provided for sources and
      receivers at arbitrary positions in the plane layered media.
      Programs are provided for determination of crustal structure
      through the inversion of surface-wave dispersion and teleseismic
      P-wave receiver functions. Inversion of broadband recordings of
      regional earthquakes for source depth, focal mechanism and seismic
      moment is also provided. Finally, a new tool, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">gsac</span>, is provided to permit
      interactive and script based manipulation of seismic traces. The
      entire package is well integrated in that the same Earth velocity
      model, waveform and graphics formats are used by all programs. A
      complete interactive graphics package is also provided.</p>
    <p> Since this package of programs continues to develop and be
      refined&nbsp; to keep current with increasing volumes of digital
      might wish to&nbsp; return to this page every few months.<br>

    <p> The reference to this set of codes is as follows: </p>
    <p> Herrmann, R. B. (2013) Computer programs in seismology: An
      evolving tool for instruction and research, <i>Seism. Res. Lettr.</i>
      <b>84</b>, 1081-1088, doi:10.1785/0220110096. <a href="Herrmann2013CPSSRL.pdf"> Download a copy of the paper.</a> </p>
    <h2>Platforms </h2>
    <p> The present code requires the use of the gcc/gfortran or clang/flang compilers
      that are available for all platforms. Interactive graphics
      requires X11 graphics.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The current distribution was tested on both an Apple M2 under
      Sonoma 15.1 using the gcc/gfortran Version 14.2.0 and clang Version 16.0.0/flang version 18.1.8 and LINUX
      Mint 21.2 using gcc/gfortran Version 12.3.0.&nbsp; Testing using
      recent compilers ensures that the CPS codes do not become
      outdated. <b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Last updated

    <p><font color="#ff0000">PC Versions</font> Currently support for
      PC's running windows requires the CYGWIN environment (<a
        href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>). The
      source codes and installation procedure are the same as for the
      UNIX/LINUX/OSX versions. <b>NOTE: This has not been tested for a
        long time</b> </p>
    <p><font color="#ff0000">UNIX/LINUX/OSX Versions</font> Source codes
      and install scripts are available. C and FORTRAN compilers are
      required - gcc and gfortran are available for free. Programs are
      distributed as gzip'd tar files (<i>.tgz</i>). Documentation in
      PostScript is provided. </p>

    <h3>LINUX distribution under VirtualBox</h3>
    <p>This document shows how to install VirtualBox on your Windows,
      Mac or Linux system, and then install a version of LINUX with
      required compilers, and finally Computer Programs in Seismology. <a
        href="CPS_VirtualBoxInstall.pdf">CPS_VirtualBoxInstall.pdf</a>.
      The advantage of this approach is that the computer disk does not
      have to be partitioned in the presence of a Windows operating
      system, and that all compilers are easily obtained. </p>
