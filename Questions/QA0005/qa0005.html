    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The following Email was received from Shan Dou on July 5, 2012: <br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font color="#000000"><font><font
            face="georgia,serif">Hi Prof. Herrmann, <br>
            <br>
            I have a couple of questions about spulse96.<br>
            <br>
            (1) For user-specified source time function (specified with
            the "-F" option), what type of file format should I use? A
            two-column ascii, a file96 format ascii, or a sac file? <br>
            <br>
            (2) I did a simple set of test with a two layer + half space
            model, and the output seismograms are compared against
            finite difference calculation results. I attached a PDF file
            in this email to show a couple of differences that can be
            seen in the results. I marked my questions in blue color,
            would you please take a look at them? It would be great if I
            can get some suggestions from you about those questions!<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much!<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Best Wishes,<br>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) The format for the "-F rfile"
      option to <span style="font-weight: bold;">spulse96</span> and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">hpulse96</span> is found in the
      respective source code, e.g., PROGRAMS.330/VOLIII/src/spulse96.f
      and PROGRAMS.330/VOLVI/src/hpulse96.f&nbsp; in <span
        style="font-style: italic;">subroutine pulud</span>. The data
      format in the spulse96.f&nbsp; has the following code:<br>
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




      read(4,*)np,dtt<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; read(4,*)(d(i),i=1,np)<br>
      <br>
      I have just modified the hspec96.f to use the same list directed
      IO input. This will be available in <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">hpulse96</span> with the next update.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The PDF document concerning this question is <a
        href="CPS_E3D_syntheticSeismograms_Comparison-2.pdf">
        CPS_E3D_syntheticSeismograms_Comparison-2.pdf</a> . <br>
      <br>
      To respond to the many questions I created a velocity model file
      and created synthetics using both modal superposition and the
      wavenumebr integration techniques.<br>
      <br>
      The scripts to run both the wavenumber integration and modal
      superposition is given in <a href="t.tgz"> t.tgz</a>. <br>
      Unpack and run using the commands:<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px;"> gunzip -c t.tgz DOALL </div>
      <br>
      Assuming that you have ImageMagick installed on your computer, you
      will then file the image files Shandou1/WK.png and
      ShanDou2/SW.png, which are compared in the next figure (note that
      each traces is scaled differently and that this is not a true
      amplitude plot):
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Wavenumber Integration - WK.png<br>
              <img src="WK.png"></td>
            <td>Modal Superposition -SW.png<nr><img src="SW.png"></nr></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p> </p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Note that the graphics is performed
      using gsac. Note also that this is slightly different from the
      CPS-E3D...pdf in that the sample interval is 6.25E-05 instead of
      6.20E-05<br>
      <br>
      Before answering the questions in the PDF, I note that Shan Dou
      actually made synthetics with a source time function with a
      duration of 4*40*6.20E-05 sec (0.0992 sec).&nbsp; The small sample
      interval requires a lot of computation time. To test the program
      results, I used the "-NDEC 16" flag on <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">hprep96</span> to effectively change the sample interval
      to 0.001 sec, and to make the computations a factor fo 256
      faster.&nbsp; To accomplish the same with the surface-wave codes,
      I change the sample interval to 0.001 sec and decreased the number
      of data points a factor of 16 to 512.&nbsp; <br>
      I also begtan the synthetic -0.01 sec before the origin time and I
      also did not make a synthetic at zero distance, since this is very
      unstable numerically.<br>
      <br>
      Several questions were asked in the PDF:<br>
      <br>
      a. The high frequency &#8220;glitches&#8221; that are superimposed on the
      longer period signal: <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(Q1:
        What</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">
      <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">causes these series of
        glitches?)</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">When adding modes, you must
        be very careful that the dispersion curves are correctly
        followed and that there is no mode jumping. "This will be a big
        problem for low-velocity layers.<br>
        <br>
        Your text indicated the use of the "-LOCK" flag in spulse96. Did
        you modify the lower part of the model to actually make locked
        modes. <br>
        <br>
        Adding mode will only provide arrival with phase velocities less
        than the highest S-wave velocity in the model. If you did not
        add a high velocity layer at depth, you model will only provide
        arrivals with phase velocities less than 2800 m/a, which means
        that near vertical reflections will not be modeled correctly.<br>
        <br>
      </span>b. The very long period signal that are present before the
      first-P arrivals, which make the time<br>
      series appear to be acausa; <span style="color: rgb(51, 51,
        255);">(Q2: What are the causes of these arrivals? Could
        inadequate</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">
      <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">amount of summed modes be
        the lead cause?)</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">When adding modes, you will
        nefver get the complete synthetic because you are actually
        phase-velocity filtering everything in an acausal manner. By
        make in the synthetics start before the origin time, and by NOT
        using a acausal Ricker wavelet, you can see the P-arrival in the
        WK synthetics.<br>
        <br>
        If you want to use a Ricker wavelet, then in gsac apply the
        commands dif, mul -1, and then ricker f 80, which will provide
        something similar to your E3D synthetics<br>
        <br>
      </span>c. Long period signals are also quite strong in later
      portion of the synthetic seismograms. Would<br>
      this be caused by inadequate amount of summed modes as well?<br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">I do not see this
        problem.&nbsp; However in your E3D synthetics there is a strange
        bifurcation (splitting) starting at time 0.12 sec at trace
        number 40</span>. It is not that extreme in the WK.png
      synthetic.<br>
      <br>

    <h2>Final comment</h2>
    There will always be a problem with the suface wave modal
    superposition because I assume that velocity increases with depth.
    This means that the eigenfunctions corresponding to the evanescent
    waves decrease with depth.&nbsp; For a model with a low velocity
    zone, there will be cases of low pahse velocity in which the
    eigenfunctions oscillate in the low velocity region but must
    exponentially decay in both directions away from this zone. In you
    problem this would require an exponential decay toward the surface,
    whereas I actually will compute an expoential increase toward the
    surface. This problem is worse at higher freuqnecies, or as the
    thickness of the top layer increases.&nbsp; Beware!!<br>
