    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<i>
    The following Email was received from Somasish Bose on March 21,
    2011 <br>
    <br>
    I shall find the surface wave dispersion curve for the events with
    epicentre distance 25 to 90 degree with sample rate 1, so the
    delta(sample interval ) is also 1 .
    <br>
    <br>
    Now to remove the instrument response i have used the following
    command...
    <br>
    <br>
    transfer from polezero subtype POLEZEROFILE to none frequency f1 f2
    f3 f4
    <br>
    <br>
    i am confuse to select f1, f2, f3, f4 .....so i used only the
    following command <br>
    <br>
    transfer from polezero subtype POLEZEROFILE to none
    <br>
    <br>
    please help me to select f1, f2, f3, f4
    <br>
    looking forward for your valuable reply .....

<h2> Response</h2>
To respond, we will consider the earthquake of 2012/10/28 03:04:11.0
56.769N 131.927W Mw=7.7 recorded on the vertical component sensors
at MGMO (37.154N 92.269W).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
My purpose in examining this event is to <br>
<ul>
  <li>test the performance of the broadband system which creates the
    trace NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC</li>
  <li>test the performance of the accelerometer which creates the
    trace NMMGMO_HNZ__.SAC</li>
  <li>test the instrument response component of the metadata
    description of each channel.</li>
</ul>
If the instruments are performing correctly and if the given
instrument responses are correct, then<br>
the deconvolved ground motions must be the same.<br>
<h3>Sample data</h3>
The next figures show the raw traces and also their Fourier amplitude spectrum. I have only applied the
command <b>rtr</b> to remove the linear trend for the plot. This is
very useful for the HNZ channel.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
There are several thing to note.  First the HHZ channel is a measure of gound velocity in the instrument
passband, while the HNZ channel is proportional to ground acceleration. Thus the spectra should differ
by a factor of 2&pi;f. This difference is seen in the frequency range from 0.1 to 1.0 Hz.  A careful examination
indicates that there are significant differences in the spectra at low and high frequencies than cannot be
accounted for by the factor of 2&pi;f.
<p>
The instrument responses are compared in the next figure. The units are in <b>counts/micron</b>.

I know the response because the polezero files have many informative comments. These comments are written by the IRIS and the SLU modified <b>rdseed</b> programs. For your information, the important parts of the polezero files are as follow:

<h3>freqlimits option</h3>
The <b>sac/gsac</b> command <b>transfer</b> has the option <i>freqlimits f1 f2 f3 f4</i>.
This option applied a zero phase filter to the transfer process. This filter has the form
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr> <td> 0 <td><td> for f < f1</td></tr>
<tr> <td> cosine taper between 0 and 1  <td><td> for  f1 < f < f2</td></tr>
<tr> <td> 1 <td><td> for f2 < f < f3</td></tr>
<tr> <td> cosine taper between 1 and 0  <td><td> for  f3 < f < f4</td></tr>
<tr> <td> 0 <td><td> for  f > f4</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
To illustrace the taper operation, I ran the following commands (the italics are comments):
<blockquote>
r imp.sac    <i>read a time series consisting of an impulse</i>
transfer from none to polezero subtype NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC.pz freqlimits 0.01 0.02 1 2
fft
psp         <i>plot the spectra</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
the following plots overlay the original plot obtained without the <i>freqlimits</i> in black
and the one using the freqlimits in red. From this plot you can understand how the <i>freqlimits</i>
option works
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="P005.png"></td>
<td><img src="P006.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Deconvolution</h3>
<p>In the next examples, we will deconvolve the traces to ground velocity using two different
<i>freqlimits</i> options. To avoid too much text here, I will indicate what was done for the HHZ channel.
Exactly the same was done for the HNZ channel. The commands used were as follow:
<blockquote>
r NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC
rtr
transfer from polezero subtype  NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC.pz to vel freqlimits 0.005 0.01 40 50
w NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC_0.005_0.01_40_50
</blockquote>
<br>and in the second example
<blockquote>
r NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC
rtr
transfer from polezero subtype  NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC.pz to vel freqlimits 0.050 0.10 5 10
w NMMGMO_HHZ__.SAC_0.050_0.10_5_10
</blockquote>
<p>
The results are compared in the next set of figures. The file name shows in the image 
indicates the values of the <i>freqlimits</i> parameters used.
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="P007.png"></td>
<td><img src="P008.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Recall that the ground motion <b>must</b> be the same.  When using the very low frequencies, we see that there is noise before the P-wave arrival, however at later simes, g.,d about 800 sec into the trace, there is a good correspondence. This tells me that the accelerometer will provide a good indication of low frequency ground motion if the ground motion is large compared to noise.
<p>
The conclusion that I obtain is that 
<ul>
<li> The instruments are functioning correctly</li>
<li> The given instrument responses are correct</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>The next question addresses the choise for the parameters of the <i>freqlimits</i> option. 
<p>The simple answer is that the passband must include the signal that you are interested in.
<p>When I perform regional moment tensor inversion, I run the following commands in a bash shell script.  Assume the
the shell variable TRACE provides the name of the waveform.
<blockquote>
<pre>
#####
#    Use Computer Programs in Seismology <b>saclhdr</b> to get values from the trace header
#####
KSTNM=`saclhdr -KSTNM $TRACE`
KCMPNM=`saclhdr -KCMPNM $TRACE`
DELTA=`saclhdr -DELTA $TRACE`
FHH=`echo $DELTA | awk '{print 0.50/$1}' `
FHL=`echo $DELTA | awk '{print 0.25/$1}' `
#####
#    FHH is the Nyquist frequency and FHL is 1/2 the Nyquist frequency
#    This step is performed so that the filtering is valid for all
#    sample rates
#####

gsac << EOF
r ${TRACE}
transfer from polezero subtype ${TRACE}.pz  TO VEL FREQLIMITS 0.002 0.003 ${FHL} ${FHH}
