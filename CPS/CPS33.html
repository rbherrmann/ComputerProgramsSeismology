COMPUTER PROGRAMS IN SEISMOLOGY - Version 3.30
</H1>
<HR>
<H2>
Introduction
</H2>
<P>
A major rewrite of Computer Programs in Seismology began in May, 1996.
The purpose was to simplify the us of synthetic seismogram programs.
The result is that the Version 2.0 Volumes III, V and VI have
been replaced. 
<P>
The characteristic feature of the new programs is that they are
no longer directed toward synthetic seismogram algorithm developement,
but rather toward routine use. All synthetic seismogram codes
use the same earth model file and all create the same output file
format. There is a uniformity of command line interface, and in program naming:
e.g., the first character of the command name indicates the computational
technique.
<P>
A 100 page tutorial on the use of the programs is available.
More detailed, UNIX-like command manual pages are still being written.
<P>
During 1997 the data analysis and inversion programs will be rewritten 
for the new format.
<P>
In February 2002, Version 3.15 was released. This version includes bug fixes
but also includes a complete interactive analysis and inversion programs
for surface waves and receiver functions.
<P>
Version 3.16 was released July 20, 2002. This includes corrections in documentation,
a new section on source pullses in the overview, PDF files of the entire
documentation instead of chapters, wavenumber integration in transverse itotropic media, and
corrections to the surface wave dispersion and/or receiver function inversion codes.
<P>
Version 3.20, scheduled was  released on September 2, 2002. This release includes a tutorial and new codes for regional focal mechanisms and source depth
determination by using surface-wave spectral amplitude radiation patterns and
waveform inversion.
focal mechanism determination from regional broadband waveforms.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="FF0000">Version 3.30</FONT></B> has the following new additions:
<UL>
<LI>CALPLOT - complete documentation and tutorial for the graphics package used by Computer Programs in Seismology.</LI>
<LI>GSAC - A SAC clone that works on UNIX/LINUX/MacOS-X and WINDOWS. The Windows
implementation used the free <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</A> environment that made portnig the code to Windows very simple. In addition a simple lcoation program that works with SAC arrival time picks is implemented so that a location consists of the following steps:
<BR><PRE>
rbh> gsac  <I>(to pick arrival times)</I>
rbh> sac2eloc *.c <I>(to read picks from SAC header and create loecate.dat></I>
rbh elocate <I>(to locate the event)</I>

The code and documentation is available for free FTP download
