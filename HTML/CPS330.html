<h2><big>Introduction</big>
</h2>
<p>
With the installation of a PDP 11/70 minicomputer in 1979
for use in seismic network analysis, a persistent effort was made
to use this tool for research. Because of an obligation felt for use
of the PDP 11/70 as well as a desire to do something for the world
wide seismological community, a set of computer programs emerged. The
programs developed actually reflect research interests of the
department as well as a desire to look at data in the manner of other
investigators. In doing so, the hope is that these tools will permit
research to progress rapidly.
</p>
<p>This led to the development of COMPUTER PROGRAMS IN SEISMOLOGY which
have been distributed to over 60 sites worldwide. The package contains
its own graphics package, and is relatively easy to install.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Version 2.0 emphasized the development of algorithms. </li>
  <li>Version 3.0 (NEW) emphasizes ease of use. <font color="#ff0000">Version
3.30</font> is the latest release. </li>
</ul>
<h2><big>Computer Programs in Seismology</big></h2>
These programs focus on the understanding and interpretation of seismic
wave propagation in the crust and upper mantle of the Earth. Synthetic
seismograph code is provided for sources and receivers at arbitrary
positions in the plane layered media. Programs are provided for
determination of crustal structure through the inversion of
surface-wave dispersion and teleseismic P-wave receiver functions.
Inversion of broadband recordings of regional earthquakes for source
depth, focal mechanism and seismic moment is also provided. Finally, a
new tool, <span style="font-weight: bold;">gsac</span>, is provided to
permit interactive and script based manipulation of seismic traces. The
entire package is well integrated in that the same Earth velocity
model, waveform and graphics formats are used by all programs. A
complete interactive graphics package is al sp provided.<br>
<br>
Since this package of programs continues to develop and be
refined&nbsp; to keep current with increasing volumes of digital
seismic data,&nbsp; tracking updates&nbsp; is important.&nbsp; You

<p><font face="helvetica, arial"><font color="#ff0000">PC Versions</font>
Currently support for PC's running windows requires the CYGWIN
environment (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>).
The source codes and installation
procedure are the same
as for the UNIX/LINUX/OSX versions.
</font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial"><font color="#ff0000">UNIX/LINUX/OSX
Versions</font>
Source codes and install scripts are available. C and FORTRAN compilers
are required - gcc and g77 are available for free. Programs are
distributed as gzip'd tar files (<i>.tgz</i>). Documentation in
PostScript is provided.

<h2><font face="helvetica, arial">GRADUATE STUDIES</font></h2>
<p>
<font face="helvetica, arial">The geophysics faculty, B. J. Mitchell,
L. Zhu, K. Koper, D. Crossley and R. Herrmann have expertise in using
modern digital seismic data, mathematics and
programming to address problems in seismic hazard, seismic network
operation,
earth structure and tectonics. </font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial">We seek qualified students for our
M.S. and Ph. D. programs. If you ae interested
or if you can recommend a student, please follow the following link to
our graduate program.

Graduate Program</a>
</font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial">The first step for applicants outside
the US is to go to the Graduate School page
and complete the Preliminary Examination. This is an unofficial
application that is FREE of cost, and permits us to evaluate the
applicant. If the faculty decide that we like the applicant, then the
official application is required.
The graduate school requires the GRE (Graduate Record Examination),
TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), 3 letters of
recommendation, offical record of
academic progress and some personal information.
</font></p>
<p><font face="helvetica, arial">We hope that you will consider
participating in our program.
