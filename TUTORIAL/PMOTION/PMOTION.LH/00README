This directory makes synthetics for rays leaving the lower hemisphere
of the focal sphere

It then uses fmplot and gsac to convert the Z R T to Radial Longitudinal and Transverse Synthetics  - the USER4 is used for the ray parameter and USER5 for the takeoff angle in degrees

Everything is then plotted using a modification of the DOPLTTEL scripts
