<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a test using a local source model for South Korea to
imvestigate the effect of source depth of an explosion&nbsp; on the
teleseismic P-wave signal at&nbsp; an arc distance of 50 degrees.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; teleseismic propagation odel is tak135sph.mod which is also
used at the receiver.&nbsp; The vertical component wave forms are shown.<br>
<br>
<h2>Example</h2>
The traces are plotted in true amplitude&nbsp; to show the effect of
depth on the obseved signal.&nbsp; Obviously the&nbsp; teleseismic T*
attenuation operator smooths out the distinct pP arrival<br>
