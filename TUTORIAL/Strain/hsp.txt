 USAGE: hspec96 [-H] [-A arg] [-K] [-N][-SU] [-SD] [-SPUP] [-SSUP] [-SPDN] [-SSDN] [-RU] [-RD] [-RPUP] [-RSUP] [-RPDN] [-RSDN] [-?] [-h]
 -H (default false)   Use Hankel function not Bessel
 -A arg (default arg=3.0) value of kr where Hn(kr) replaces
             Jn(kr) in integration - only used when -H is used
 -K      (default Futterman) use Kjartansson Causal Q
 -N      (default causal) use non-causal Q
 The following govern wavefield at source. The default is the entire wavefield
 -SU      (default whole wavefield) Compute only upgoing                wavefield from the source
 -SD      (default whole wavefield) Compute only downgoing                wavefield from the source
  -SPUP  Include upward P at source
  -SSUP  Include upward S at source
  -SPDN  Include downward P at source
  -SSDN  Include downward S at source
 The following govern wavefield at receiver. The default is the entire wavefield
  -RD    Only downgoing waves at receiver
  -RU    Only upgoing waves at receiver
  -RPUP  Include upward P at receiver
  -RSUP  Include upward S at receiver
  -RPDN  Include downward P at receiver
  -RSDN  Include downward S at receiver
