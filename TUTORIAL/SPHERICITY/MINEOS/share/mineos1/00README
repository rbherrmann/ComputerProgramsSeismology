This directory contains the scripts for comparing the mineos and CPS dispersion curves.

The resulting graphics are placed in HTML.SW

Directories

	nnDEMO6 - perform the comparison for a spherical model

		RUN_MINEOS.sh tak135-f
		DOSEL
		DOCLEAN ( to clean up )

		This places the graphics qDEMO6SRFPHG96.png qDEMO6SRFPHV96.png 
		and text files 12.txt and 17.txt into HTML.SW

	fnDEMO6 - perform the comparison for a flat model. This
                compares the mineos free-oscillation code to the surface wave
                code with no Earth flattening. This demonstrates the need to
		flatten  

		RUN_MINEOS.sh tak135-f  (or copy the_S and _T files 
                  from nnDEMO6)
		DOSEL
		DOCLEAN ( to clean up )

		This places the graphics qflatDEMO6SRFPHG96.png 
                qflatDEMO6SRFPHV96.png  into HTML.SW

	HTML.SW - the is the web page master for the comparison
