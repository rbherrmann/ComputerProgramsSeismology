    <h1>Wavenumber  integration tests</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This set of tests uses the CPS program sequence <b>hprep96</b>, <b>hspec96</b>,  <b>hpulse9</b> and <b>f96tosac</b> to create complete synthetics.
</p>
<p>We consider the the case of a source at a depth of 10km and epicentral distances of 1, 2, 3, 10 and 20 km.
<p>The two models are

The processing script for this angle of incidence is <a href="CPSWK/DOIT">DOIT</a> which calls the script <a href="CPSWK/DODIST">DODIST</a>. These3 scripts is annotated with comments that describe the operations. Note that the
shell script <b>DOPLTPNG</b> is used to convert the CPS PLT files to a png file using the ImageMagick convert. If ImageMagick is not installed, do something like
<br>
<pre>
plotnps -F7 -W10 -EPS -K < P001.PLT > P001.eps
</pre>
and then use some other code to convert the Encapsulated PostScript <i>P001.eps</i> to a useful format. The <b>DOPLTPNG</b> script is given below.
</p> 
<p>The <b>DODIST</b> invokes <b>sacampl</b> with the <i>-TXT</i> flag and the angle is defined as the arc tangent of (epicentral distance/source depth).
This means that the ASCII file <i>sacsampl_distance.txt</i> will be available. As an aside, if one wishes to compare the synthetics response to the output of <b>sacampl</b>, then use <b>gsac</b> to create a CSV file.
</p>
<p>
Running the <b>DOIT</b> creates 8 PNG files. Three compare the time domain seismograms as a function of epicentral distance for the R, T and Z components.
The remaining five compare the Soil/Rock spectra ratios as a function of distance.
</p>
<p>The plots are
<table>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/RSS.png"><br>Comparison of the radial component traces for the Rock (red) and Soil (blue) traces as a function of epicentral distance. </td></tr>
</p>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/TSS.png"><br>Comparison of the transverse component traces for the Rock (red) and Soil (blue) traces as a function of epicentral distance. </td></tr>
<h2>DOPLTPNG</h2>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/ZSS.png"><br>Comparison of the vertical component traces for the Rock (red) and Soil (blue) traces as a function of epicentral distance. </td></tr>
</teble>
<br>
The arrival between P and S at 20 km on the rock trace is an artifact of the wavenumebr integration and can be controlled by effectively making the &Delta;k smaller. The waveforms are simpler in appearance since we are3 essentially looking at the direct P and S rays from the source. The traces for the soil model
show some reverberations.
</p>
<p>The next step was to window the traces on the S wave, take the Fourier transform and then save the amplitude spectra.
At each distance a spectral ratio was obtained and the ration for each component were compared to the quarter-wavelength formula.
The plots for the five distances are as follow:
<br>
<table>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/Ratio_01.png"><br> Site effect ratios at an epicentral distance of 1.0 km.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/Ratio_02.png"><br> Site effect ratios at an epicentral distance of 2.0 km.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/Ratio_03.png"><br> Site effect ratios at an epicentral distance of 3.0 km.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/Ratio_10.png"><br> Site effect ratios at an epicentral distance of 10.0 km.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="CPSWK/Ratio_20.png"><br> Site effect ratios at an epicentral distance of 20.0 km.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
</p>
<p>
The spectral ratios at 1, 2 and 3 km look very similar to the plane wave results. The quarter-wavelength formula seems to fit the horizontal R and T components. 
</p>
<p>
At a distance of 10km the amplification on the radial component increases, while at 20 km, this amplification becomes very large, although the rations of the Z and T components seem to behave well.
