<header><h1>Computer Programs in Seismology </h1> <h2>Surface-wave Detection</h2></header>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Seismic observatory processing is tuned to detect and locate the majority of earthquakes which are characterized by well observed body wave arrivals. However there is a class of events  which are often missed because of their low frequency signals. While the body waves may not be observed, the surface waves generated may permit detection and location. These events may be due to "slow earthquakes",  landslides or other phenomena.
</p>
<p>
This tutorial focuses on the use of the surface wave to detect an event through a set of examples.
<p>
<h2>2. Signal Processing Review</h2>
<p>
A review of the Fourier transform and its properties, the Hilbert transform and the Discrete Fourier Transform are given in 
<a href="Section_01/Theory.pdf"> Theory.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>
This review gave the background for applying time shifts, removing the effects of dispersion and the creation on the signal envelope.
This tutorial focuses on the use of the surface-wave signal to detect and event. It will do this by compressing the signal and forming an envelope.
<a href="Section_01/index.html"> Section_01</a> shows some characteristics of signals as a function of epicentral distance in a spherical Earth model.
</p>
<h2>3. Signal Compression - Part 1</h2>
<p>
<a href="Section_02/index.html">Section_02</a> creates a sample data set  to test the compression algorithm for the simple case of noise free observations. Thus the retults are independent of the event magnitude.
