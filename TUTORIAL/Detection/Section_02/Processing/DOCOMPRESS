#	Sacfile	- recorded waveform for this test
#		normally one would access the particular NNSSSSSCCLL for a station
#		location from the data base
#	DIST	distance in km from the trial epicenter to the station
#	Dispersion - path dependent dispersionfor the particular NNSSSSSCCCLL, e.g.,
#		if Z component then this would be the Rayleigh disperion
#		if R component then this would be the Rayleigh disperion
#		if T component then this would be the Love     dispersion 
#	UMIN, UMAX - group velocity window for the signal that focuses on the
#		surface wave. Note tis could be extraced from the disperion curves
#		The purpose of this is to grab a segment of the continuous recording
#		for this analysis
#	NZYEAR NZJDAY NZHOUR NZMIN NZSEC NZMSEC trial origin time
#####
#	Output
#	The result will be a phase-match filtered compressed signal, with the
#	name ${SacFile}.compress

#####
#       the steps are as follow
#       window the trace using taper. it is assumed that UMIN and UMAX are actually
#       0.9 minimum group velocity and 1.1 maximum group velocity respectively
#       So apply a taper

#       get the data segment
