    <h1>Layer1</h1>
    The purpose here is two fold - to make synthetics and then to make
    receiver functions from them. We examine a horizontal profile with
    observations at the surface
    between x-coordinates if 0 and 200 km. The source is placed at
    (100,100), e.g., an x-coordinate of 100 km
    and a depth of 100 km.
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The velocity model is contained within the <b>DOIT</b> file. The
      receiver positions are also defined in this file. The sequence of
      commands to
      make the Sac files is just

    for just one ray will be shown.

      After the computations are completed the script <b>DOPLT</b> is
      run to plot record sections, and in this simple case compare the
      receiver function from the synthetic at receiver position 200 km
      to the analytic value using <b>hrftn96</b>. The plots are in the
      next two figures.

    This is the output of <b>cpulse96</b>. <b>gsac</b> was used to
    make the plot. Note that this is a relative amplitude plot. The peak
    amplitude of each traces has the same amplitude on the plot. In the
    plots, a positive amplitude is to the left. At the station at 200
    km, the initial Z and R are positive. The initial P wave is in a
    direction upward and to the right away from the source. At a
    distance of 0 km, the ray leaves the source up and to the left. The
    initial P motion here is
    up on the vertical and down on the horizontal, meaning in the
    negative z-direction,&nbsp; which is what is expected. The normal
    use of R meaning Radial away form the source does not apply here.

      The computation of the receiver function presents an opportunity
      to better understand the meaning of the entry in column 8 of <i>cseis96.amp</i>.
      For the receiver distance of 200 km, this line for the direct P
      ray is
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>    1   21  0.19849E+02  0.11161E-01  0.13669E-01  0.31416E+01  0.00000E+00 -0.696068E+00    1  0.33000E+01  0.80000E+01  0.00000E+00  0.28000E+01  0.60000E+01
</pre>
    <br>
    The angle -0.696068E+00 in radians is measured with respect to the
    horizontal and corresponds to 39.3968 degrees. The angle required
    for the ray parameter is measured with respect to the vertical and
    is thus 50.083 degrees. The ray parameter is <i>sin(50.083
      degrees)/8.0 = 0.09587</i> s/km. Since this is a plane layered
    model, <b>time96</b> can be used to get the plane wave ray
    parameter and the travel time by the commands
    <br>
    <pre>time96 -EVDP 100 -DIST 100 -M model.d -P -RAYP 
time96 -EVDP 100 -DIST 100 -M model.d  
</pre>
    <br>
    From these two commands one obtains 9.59405228E-02 s/km for the ray
    parameter and 19.8530426s for the travel time. <br>
    in addition the negative value indicates that this ray goes up from
    the source. Since it is greater than -&#960;/2, the ray goes upward and
    to the right of the source.

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The comparison of receiver functions was not exact. What is
        the effect of using a smaller value of <i>dt</i> in the
        synthetics.
        <br>
        Answer: a little bit using dt - 0.0625s.<br>

        </center>
      </li>
      <li>Test whether the problem was due to the use of curved
        wavefronts in <b>cseis96</b> rather than the assumed incident
        plane wave by placing the source deeper, e.g., perhaps 2000 km.
        <br>
        Answer: Yes, much better even with the original dt of 0.125s.<br>
