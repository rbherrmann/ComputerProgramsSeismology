    <h1>Layer3</h1>
    <p>
      the purpose of this is to show how ray parameter filtering is
      applied using <b>cpusle96</b> and then to discuss the
      implication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything is run as in the Layer1 example, except that the there
      are additional options applied to <b>cpulse96</b>, e.g.,
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>cpulse96 -V -p -l 4 -EXF -DELAY 10 -PMIN 0.08 -PMAX 0.10  | f96tosac -B
</pre>
    <br>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now consider the following plots
      <br>
    </p>
    <center>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <center>CRAY96.PLT</center>
              <br>
              <img src="CRAY96.png"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </center>
    <br>
    Note that since the input to <b>cseis96</b> did not change, the
    same rays were computed.
    <p></p>
    <p>
      There are two significant differences compared to the Layer1
      example. This can be seen in the record sections
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <center>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <center>ZEX.PLT</center>
              <br>
              <img src="ZEX.png"></td>
            <td>
              <center>REX.PLT</center>
              <br>
              <img src="REX.png"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </center>

    As expected the choice of a positive values for the ray parameter
    limits did filter reduce the number of rays to make the seismograms.
    However the synthetics do not look much like those from the Layer1
    discussion. By examining the output file <i>cseis96.amp</i>, one
    sees that many different ray parameters make up the synthetic at 200
    km, but only a few of these are in the desired range.
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This emphasizes the need to better approximate an indicent plane
      wave.
    </p>
    <h1>Plane wave</h1>
    <p>To investigate both the ray parameter filtering and also the
      improvement of the plane-wave approximation,
      the source position was changed to be deeper and also farther away
      from the array to give the desired
      ray parameters. The command sequence is now
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>cprep96 -M model.d -d dfile -HS 2000 -XS -2000 -HR 0 -DOALL  -DOCONV
cseis96 -R &gt; cseis96.out
cpulse96 -V -p -l 4 -EXF -DELAY 10 -PMIN 0.08 -PMAX 0.10  | f96tosac -B
cray96 -XMIN -2100 -XMAX 250 -ZMIN 0 -ZMAX 2100
</pre>
    <br>
    The command line for <b>cprep96</b> has repositioned the source.
    The command line for
    <b>cpulse</b> applies the phase velocity filter. Finally the plot
    limits for<b>cray96</b> are changed because of the new source
    position.
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The plots are

    <p>It is interesting now that arrivals of all of the receivers are
      similar. They only differ because of the moveout of the incoming
      signal across the array. Since the first time sample is <i>delay</i>
      seconds before the first arrival,
      an overlay of all traces relative to their beginning would show
      little difference [GSAC: plot relative overlay on].
    </p>
    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      This exercise has shown ray parameter filtering and also the need
      for a deep source to model plane waves.
      The horizontal position of that source is determined by trial and
      error.
