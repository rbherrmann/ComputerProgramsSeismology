    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>During a long career,&nbsp; V. Červený&nbsp; contributed much to
      seismic ray theory. The initial impetus was for the determination
      of crustal structure from refraction profiles. Initial codes were
      for a 2-D model with corrections to represent 3-D propagation. One
      program was named <b>seis81</b> which is encapsulated in the
      Computer Programs in Seismology (Herrmann, 2013)&nbsp; program <b>cseis96.













      </b>The techniques are described n a number of publications
      (Červený et al, 1977; Červený, 1985; Červený, 2010;&nbsp; Červený
      and Pšenčík. 2011).<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>cseis96 </b>differs from the original <b>seis81 </b>in that
      the radiation patterns from point force and moment tensor sources
      was corrected and in&nbsp;&nbsp; revised&nbsp; output formats. The
      significant difference in making synthetics is that the formtion
      of the time series is make by the program <b>cpulse96</b> after <b>cseis96</b>
      is run.&nbsp; The program <b>cprep96</b> is a front end that
      simplifies the preparation input for <b>seis81</b>. However&nbsp;
      <b>cseis96 </b>can run more complicated models if the input data
      set is created manually. The documentation for this is in <i>PROGRAMS.330/VOLIX/DOC/seis81.txt.<br>
      </i></p>
    <p>As mentioned, <b>seis81</b> was developed to interpret
      refraction line observations. The codes use asymptotic ray theory
      to make synthetics. The implication is that the codes cannot model
      phenomena such as the classical refraction or a Rayleigh wave.
      This tutorial investigates the use of these codes to make
      synthetics that can be used to model teleseismic P-wave receiver
      functions which assume a plane wave incident to the base of the
      structure. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the process of testing this use, updates were made on November
      1, 2022&nbsp; to the source codes in <i>PROGRAMS.330/VOLIX/src</i>,
      specifically to <b>cprep96, </b><b>cseis96</b> and <b>cpulse96</b>.
      Changes were made in format statements since the testing required
      placing the source at a great depth to be able to approximate an
      incident plane wave. The numerical integration to define the ray
      path in <b>cseis96</b> was upgraded to use double precision since
      there were significant problems in shooting a ray to a given
      receiver position when using very large source depths to
      approximate incident plane waves. In addition, changes were made
      to <b>cpulse96</b> to permit a new way to define the time of the
      first sample and to restrict the rays contributing to the
      seismogram by specifying a range of acceptable ray parametes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The ray tracing code works by shooting a set of rays through the
      structure until a pair is found that bracket the horizontal
      position of the receiver. At this point the angle of the ray
      leaving the source is refined so that the ray hits the receiver
      within a given accuracy. The ray so defined uses Snell's law
      locally at each interface. The final step is to account for the
      reflection and transmission at each interface and the geometrical
      spreading. &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The program <b>cpulse96 </b>was initially written assuming that
      the source is to the left of the profile and waves propagate to
      the right in the +x direction. Thus the&nbsp; RDD, RDS, RSS,. REX,
      RVF and RHF&nbsp; Green's functions will be such that the motion
      of a P wave incident at the surface will be up on the vertical
      component and positive on the radial component or down and
      negative if the&nbsp; initial motion is a dilation.&nbsp; As will
      be show below, if the source is to the right of the array, then
      the horizontal&nbsp; motion will be reversed.&nbsp; Although the
      Green's fucntions have 'R' in their name, e.t., REX, the&nbsp;
      motions should be interpreted as motions with respect to the
      direction of the horizontal x-axis rather as radial with respect
      to the source.&nbsp; This means that computation of receiver
      functions for observations at distances less than the source
      position (e.g., in the negative x-direction), must have the R
      Green's function reversed, or if not, then the receiver function
      inverted.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For ease of making profiles, the Sac header variables STLA and
      EVLA will be undefined, e.g., -12345.0. STLO and EVLO will be the
      horizontal positions of the receiver and source. The distance DIST
      is defined at STLO - EVLO. Thus for sources to the right (more in
      +x direction) representing ways in the negative x-direction, the
      distance will be negative. Again this is for use in plotting. The
      parameter LCALDA= false int he Sac header so that the distances
      are nor recomputed from used int given latitudes and longitudes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Given these header values, it is possible to use the <b>gsac</b>
      commands <i>prs STLO</i> or <i>prs DIST</i> to make record
      section profiles. in the examples below for the modeling of
      observations above a subduction zone, <i>prs STLO </i>is used.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Since this tutorial is directed toward modeling teleseismic
      P-wave receiver functions, only the EX Green's functions will be
      used since these only emit P waves at the source.<br>
      <i> </i></p>
    <h1>Codes and scripts</h1>
    <p>The scripts for the examples below are contained in the file <a
        href="Cerveny.tgz">Cerveny.tgz</a>. Download this file and
      unpack using the command <br>
    </p>
    <pre> 
gunzip -c Cerveny.tgz | tar xf -

    This will create a directory structure, such as

    Note the names of the subdirectories. These will be the headings of
    each of the examples given below. Thus if an example has the heading
    <b>Layerb</b>, then the computational scripts will be in <i>Cerveny/Layerb<b>.</b></i>
    <p></p>
    <p> Since the objective of this tutorial is to model teleseismic
      P-wave receiver functions for observations above a subduction
      zone. There are some caveats. <br>
    </p>
    <p> First <b>cseis96 </b>is 2-D code. Thus a subduction zone is
      modeled as an&nbsp; infinitely long 2-D structure and the source
      and receivers are on a line perpendicular to strike. If this were
      not true, then 3-D code would be required. The next limitation is
      that the receiver function analysis assumes a plane wave incident
      at the base of the structure while <b>cseis96</b> uses a point
      source. If the point source is placed deep enough, then the
      incident wave field may be assumed to approximate a plane wave.
      However some experimentation is required to test this assumption.</p>
    <p>The following sections consider a suite of models, ranging from a
      single layer over a halfspace model&nbsp; to a complex subduction
      zone. For&nbsp; the&nbsp; &nbsp; plane layered halfspace models,
      the synthetics and receiver functions can be compared to more
      exact synthetics derived using the <b>hspec96</b> and <b>rftn96</b>
      codes.&nbsp; The receiver functions computed&nbsp; using <b>hrftn96


      </b>can be compared to those obtained by running <b>saciterd </b>with

      the horizontal and vertical component synthetics derived
      from&nbsp; <b>cseis96.</b> <b><br>
      </b></p>
    <p>The user has a choice when trying to model teleseismic waves
      incident from the right or the left of the structure.&nbsp; One
      can fi the structure and make separate computations for with
      sources to the left and the right, or one can have the source to
      the left, but two models, were are reflections of the other.&nbsp;
      Some experimentation in defining the source position for receiver
      function analysis, since one is interested in a certain set of ray
      parameters from the source (s/km) that reach the station. This
      will be illustrated in the examples.</p>
    <p>in the examples below for the subduction model, the model extends
      down to about 300 km, but the source depth is 16000 km. Because of
      the different vertical extents, it is acceptable to ignore the
      upper structure to define the horizontal offset of the source in
      order for a given ray parameter to "hit" the receiver. A simple
      program <b>ptoradian</b> is provided to give an acceptable range
      of angles that <b>cseis96</b> should use for efficient
      computations.<br>
      <b> </b></p>
    <h2>cprep96<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The program <b>cprep96 </b>prepares the data set for the <b>cseis96



      </b>program by creating the file <i>cseis96.dat.</i> The format
      of that file is given in <i>PROGRAMS.330/VOLIX/DOC/seis81.txt.</i>&nbsp;

      The importance of the <i>-XS sourcex</i> command line flag is
      illustrated in Figure 1. This figure shows the ideal ray paths to
      each receiver associated with an incident plane wave. Since <b>cseis96</b>
      can only use point sources, it is assumed that the point source
      (red circle) is at a depth such that the wavefront is effectively
      planar.&nbsp; To preserve the ray geometry, the source must be
      moved horizontally as the receiver position changes.<br>

    <p>The <i>-R reverb </i>is useful to reduce the number of rays
      considered. The format is simple, a list of layer number - bounce
      pairs, e.g.,</p>
    <pre>1 3<br>2 3<br>3 3<br>4 1<br></pre>
    <p>which means, for example that at most 3 ray segments are
      permitted in layer 2. For P-SV waves this would permit<br>
      8 rays, e.g., PPP, PPS, PSP, PSS, SSS, SSP, SPS and
      SPP.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this option is not ste the <b>cprep96</b> may
      generate a lot of rays, perhaps 40,000 for a 4 layer model.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The format for <i>cseis96.dat&nbsp; </i>is given in the
      aforementioned <i>seis81.txt</i>. Just before the ray description
      there is a line created by <b>cprep96</b> which reads<br>

    <p>You may wonder why the limits in the example line are π to -π and
      -π to π. The code permits velocity gradients. Thus if velocity
      increases with depth and one wanst a ray from the source to a
      receiver above the source, the ray will go upward&nbsp; at short
      distances&nbsp; and downward for large horizontal distances. The
      range given here covers all possibilities. However examining all
      possibilities is time consuming. For the purpose of modeling
      teleseismic P waves, this line will be changed to make the
      computations more efficient<br>
    </p>
    <p>Following this is the ray description for each ray<br>
    </p>
    <pre>    0    2    2    1<br>    0    2   -2    1<br>    0    2    2   -1<br>    0    2   -2   -1<br></pre>
    which represent the rays P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>1</sub>,
    P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>S<sub>1</sub>,
    respectively. In this notation the <i>0</i> indicates that an
    acceptable ray can go up or down from the source, the initial <i>2</i>
    says that there are two ray segments, which is followed by a layer
    number and whether the ray of P (positive) or S (negative).<br>
    <br>
    Note again that the number of rays can quickly become large if
    conversions between P and SV are permitted.&nbsp; For example if
    there is a single layer over a halfspace, then there will be 2 rays
    in the halfspace, 4 direct rays reaching the surface, as in the
    example above. If the first set of multiples are permitted in the
    layer, then there will be 16 rays, e.g., P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>1</sub>P<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>
    . This is easily understood if one writes the ray type for each
    segment in binary, using 0 for P and 1 for S. Thus one would have 0
    or 1&nbsp; for the halfspace, and then 0 or 1 for each segment in
    the layer. Thus this example may be written as 0 ro the halfspace
    and 110 for the layer.&nbsp; If there are many layers, it will be
    possible to have 10's of thousands of rays/.<sub> </sub><br>

    <p>The next program that is executed is <b>cseis96</b>. Its command

      This requires the use of the <i>-R </i>flag with&nbsp; <b>cseis96</b>.
      As will be seen below, such a plot can be very complicated, and it
      is recommended that only one receiver position be considered. This

    For the emulation of the teleseismic arrival, which will be

    have to manually change the TO so some large value and have VRED=
    0.0.&nbsp; The <i>-DELAY delay </i>option says to start the
    synthetics <i>delay&nbsp; </i>seconds before the first arrival.<br>

    <h1>Test Cases</h1>
    The following test cases were designed to learn how to adapt the
    code for the purpose of modeling teleseismic P-wave receiver
    functions. The sequence of tests<br>
    leading to the images shown in this tutorial can be obtained&nbsp;
    by executing the following commands in order:<br>

    <br>
    The P velocities in the layers are 6.0, 8.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 8.5 km/s
    from top to bottom. The layer boundaries on the right side of the
    model are at 0, 40, 200, 207 and 300 km. (The lower boundary at
    about 600 km is inserted to that the source is oin a layer).
    <p></p>
    <p> The layer boundaries use a simple format that is described in
      the tutorial at <i>PROGRAMS.330/DOC/OVERVIEW.pdf/cps330o.pdf</i>.
      Thus the layering consists of linear segments. </p>
    <p> <b>NOTE:</b> This is not a restriction of <b>cseis96</b>. The
      layering can be specified to be smoother by uaing cubic splines -
      see the documantation at <i>PROGRAMS.330/VOLIX/DOC/seis81.txt</i>.
    </p>
    <p> To create synthetics to emulate teleseismic arrivals and for
      computational efficiency, the processing scripts will select a
      target x-coordinate, x<sub>rec</sub>, for the station. It will
      then be neceasary to specifiy the source location, e.g., (x<sub>src</sub>,
      z<sub>src</sub>) where the z<sub>src</sub> is much larger than the
      structure thickness. In this case a&nbsp; simple approximation is
      that the horizontal offset from the source will be <i>x<sub>offset</sub>
        =z<sub>src</sub> tan ( p V)</i> where&nbsp; <i>p</i> is the ray
      parameter of&nbsp; the teleseismic arrival and <i>V</i> is the
      P-velocity at the source depth. If the ray is propagating in the <i>+x</i>
      direction, then x<sub>src</sub> = x<sub>rec</sub> - x<sub>offset</sub>.
      If&nbsp; the ray is propagating in the <i>-x</i> direction, e.g.,
      a reverse profile, then x<sub>src</sub> = x<sub>rec</sub> + x<sub>offset</sub>.
    </p>
    To facilitate the specification of the range of acceptable angles
    for the Cerveny code, a simple Fortran program was written. If the
    source depth or velocity change, just modify in the definitions at
    the beginning of the code. The code, ptoradian.f , compilation and
    output are as follow:

      By default <b>cprep96</b> will compute all ray conversions, which
      will create a huge number of rays. The <i>-R reverb</i> option to
      <b>cprep96</b> is used to restrict the number of boundings in the
      layers of the model to 3,3,1 and 1, respectively. the <i>3</i>
      means that ion a given leyer, PPP, PPS, PSP, PSS, SSS, SSP, SPP
      and SPP are considered, which should be sufficient for this study.
    </p>
    <p><br>
      The following tutorials consider wave propagation with receiver
      positions from 50 to 8000 km along the surface of the model above.
      At 800 km, for the the forward model, the way interaction should
      approximate what would be expected for a single layer over a
      halfspace, which can be compared to the output of <b>hrftn96</b>
      to test the code. This is why <b>cseis96</b> computations were
      extended to double precision when computing the ray from the
      soruce to the receiver. </p>
    <h3>Forward profile</h3>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p> As expected the synthetics and receiver function show the effect
      of the 2-D structure. It us useful to compare the RFTN plots
      side-by-side: <br>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <center>Forward Profile (+x)</center>
              <br>
              <img src="NsubductionReverbF/RFTN.png"></td>
            <td>
              <center>Reversed Profile (-x)</center>
              <br>
              <img src="NsubductionReverbR/RFTN.png"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <br>
      First note that the RFTN's for the reverse profile are reversed in
      sign. This is because the REX Green's function does not show
      radial displacements, but displacements that are positive in the
      (-x) direction. This plot could be flipped by multiplying the
      traces by -1! </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> The traces look different in the 0 - 200 km range for the
      station position. For this reversed profile one sees the arrivals
      trapped within the wedge. The only disturbing feature is the shape
      of the receiver function at about 20 sec after the first "bump".
      To understand the difference, the following figure compares the
      receiver functions generated by <b>hrftn96</b> for the simple
      single-layer over a halfspace (Simple.sac) and for a five layer
      flat model (Layered.sac) corresponding to the flat subduction
      structure at the right of the model. Finally the receiver
      functions corresponding to the 2-D forward model at receiver
      position 600 km are given in Forward600.sac while Reverse600.sac
      is for the reversed profile. In performing this comparison the
      reverse profile receiver function were multiplied by (-1) for
      comparison, thus converting modtion in the (-x) direction to
      radial with respect to the source. <br>
    </p>
    <table>
    </table>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="DOCMPRFTN//RFTNcmp.png"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    This comparison shows that the difference at about 20s on the plot
    is due to the multiplayer structure. Comparing the arrival at about
    72s of the Layered.sac and Reverse600.sac, shows an initial
    agreement. The differences may be due to the need for the model to
    be wider (?), or the need for more bounding rays in the Cerveny
    simulation. Recall that only 3 reverberations were permitted in the
    upper layers.
    <p></p>
    <h1>Final thoughts</h1>
    <p> Additional model studies can be performed. These synthetics show
      structural features well because of the small number of layers and
      the sharp velocity contrasts. If there are gradients, then
      features will become less obvious. </p>
