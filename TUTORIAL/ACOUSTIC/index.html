<header><h1>Computer Programs in Seismology Tutorial</h1> <h2>Acoustic waves from source</h2></header>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The velocity model format used in Computer Programs in Seismology
    has long had the provision for conveniently incorporating a layered
    atmosphere from the viewpoint of having the&nbsp; source or receiver
    depth of 0 km be at the air-solid interface.&nbsp; This is
    accomplished by the use of negative layer thicknesses to indicate
    layering above a reference datum, usually the surface of the earth.
</p><p>
    The computational codes use a coordinate system with the z=0
    corresponding to the top of the model, and positive z corresponds to
    greater depth.&nbsp; With the convention of layers above the datum
    used in the model formats, the synthetic seismogram codes does the
    book keeping necessary to convert the user view to that required for
    computation.
</p><p>
    As an interesting exercise, we will consider the wavefields
    generated in the air (pressure field) and in the solid (velocities)
    from point explosion sources in the air and solid. In addition the
    pressure field in the atmosphere is also computed for various
    dislocation sources.
</p><p>
    The positions of the sources (small red dots) and receivers (large
    blue dots) are shown in Figure 1.&nbsp; Although in actuality
    observations are made at the surface, the framework indicated here
    could be used to drive detailed atmospheric models.&nbsp; To predict
    pressure fields at large distances, ray theory may be the most
    efficient technique for high frequency signals, since the
    computational effort inherent in wave-number integration would be
    too great.&nbsp; So the idea here is to prototype the expected
    pressure signals on a hemisphere about the source, and then
    eventually to use a representation theorem to uses these motions as
    input to a ray theory or other numerical technique.
</p><p>
    The receivers in Figure 1 are at a distance of 20 km from the
    coordinate system origin (the intersection of the vertical and
    horizontal axes). For position in the air, only the pressure field
    will be measurable, while at the surface, pressure and ground
    motions can be determined.

    The velocity model used is very simple:&nbsp; a single layer
    atmosphere overlying a solid half-space.&nbsp; The 
      <i>model96</I> file description is given
    in the file <span style="font-style: italic;">crust-atmos.mod</span>:

    Here you can see the use of the negative depth to indicate that a
    user specification of a source depth of 1 km means that the depth in
    the internal model will be 41 km from the top, or 1 km into the
    solid.&nbsp; Note that this model is just used for testing. The
    density of air at sea level is about 0.00129 gm/cc.
</p>
    <h2>Processing</h2>
<p>
    The processing is performed with the script <a href="DOIT">DOIT</a>
    and the graphics by the script <a href="FIGURES/DOFIG">DOFIG</a> in
    the sub-directory FIGURES.
</p><p>
    The DOIT script treats the model as two halfspaces which means that
    there will be no returns from the top and bottom interfaces.
</p>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
    <h3>Effect of source depth</h3>
<p>
    the first example considers the pressure field measured in the
    atmosphere at an angle of 80 degrees measure from the horizontal.
    The observation is at a distance of 3.473 km and an elevation of
    19.696 km.&nbsp; The plots shown below present the Greens functions
    for a moment of 1.0E+20 dyne-cm. A relative amplitude scale is used.
</p><p>
    Since dislocation sources cannot occur in the atmosphere, the plots
    for the PSS, PDD and PDS Greens functions have no data for negative
    receiver depths (e.g., in the air).
</p><p>
    Focus first on the PEX Green function.&nbsp; For atmospheric sources
    the signal consists of two pulses, which are the direct signal and
    the reflection from the solid surface.

      If a absolute amplitudes were plotted, the observations for the
      buried sources would appear as straight lines because the
      amplitudes are so small compared to the wavefield due to an
      atmosphere source (for an explosion).&nbsp; For the PEX Greens
      functions the largest negative amplitudes are -0.07, -0.07,
      -2.9E-07, -1.38E-07, -7.73E-08, -4.01E-08, -3.53E-08, -2.99E-08
      and -2.73E-07 for source depths of -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
      km. This lower amplitudes for the buried source can be understood
      from ray theory for which the spectral amplitude should vary as<br>
      Mo/([4 &pi; &rho;<sub>s</sub> &alpha;<sub>s</sub><sup>3
      </sup>]<sup>5/2</sup> [&rho;<sub>s</sub> &alpha;<sub>s / </sub>&rho;<sub>a</sub>
      &alpha;<sub>a </sub>]<sup>1/2</sup>)&nbsp; for an explosion source
      in the solid observed in the atmosphere, and
</p><p>
Mo/[4 pi &rho;<sub>a</sub>&alpha;<sub>a</sub><sup>3
      </sup>] for an explosion source in the atmosphere and observed in
      the atmosphere.
The ratio of the amplitudes&nbsp; is just<br>
      ([&rho;<sub>s</sub>&alpha;<sub>s</sub><sup>3</sup>
      ] / [&rho;<sub>a</sub>&alpha;<sub>a</sub><sup>3 </sup>
      ])( [&rho;<sub>a</sub>&alpha;<sub>a / </sub>&rho;<sub>s</sub>&alpha;<sub>s
      </sub>]<sup>1/2</sup>), which is factor of about 1.1E+6,
      which is the difference in the amplitudes shown in the second
      figure.<br>

    <h2>Radiated pressure field of a 1 km deep source</h2>
<p>
    This example considers the pressure field at all sensors in the
    atmosphere, whose location is defined by the angle with respect to
    the horizontal. An angle of 90 degrees indicates a receiver directly
    above the source. In the following set of plots, all traces use the
    same scale so that amplitudes can be compared.&nbsp; the larges
    amplitude are above the source.<br>
    <br>
</p><p>
    For this set of examples we see two arrivals for small angles.
    Focusing on the receiver closest to the surface, e.g., angle of 10
    degrees, the first arrival at 14 sec travel time consists of the
    P-wave propagating through the solid (about 3 seconds) which then
    propagates 3.4 km in air (11 sec). The low frequency arrival at
    about 68 sec is&nbsp; due to the air wave generated by the surface
    deformation above the source. <br>
