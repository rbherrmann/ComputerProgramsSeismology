    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The files for this example are in EMPIRICAL/GREEN/EXAMPLE1. To
    perform the processing, you will have to set your shell PATH
    variable to point to the current direction, e.g., in bash
    <pre>export PATH=:.:$PATH

</pre>
    You will find the following files in this directory:
    <ul>
      <li>SIUCBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK - This is a typical result of noise
        cross-correlation </li>
      <li>DOSRF - This creates the eigenfunctions required to give the
        theoretical dispersion</li>
      <li>MFTDOOVERLAY</li>
      <li>PHVDOOVERLAY - These are sample scripts for overlaying a
        dispersion curve on the results of the processing. </li>
      <li>CUS.mod - Velocity model to provide dispersion curves</li>
      <li>DOCLEAN - This cleans up after a processing run</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The two scripts MFTDOOVERLAY and PHVDOOVERLAY can be modified to
      use results of your tomography to provide reference dispersion
      curves. </p>
    <p> Note that if you do not have an Intel/AMD computer, e.g., a
      SPARC you will have to get the correct byte order in the Sac file,
      but entering the commands <br>
    </p>
    <pre>     saccvt -I &lt; SIUCBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK &gt; t
     mv t SIUCBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK
</pre>
    <br>
    <h2>Starting the program</h2>
    <br>
    The program <b>do_mft</b> options can be seen by running the
    command
    <pre>do_mft -h
Usage: do_mft [-Nnumberperpage] [-G] [-T] [-11MIN min11] [-11MAX max11] [-DMIN dmin] [-DMAX dmax] sacfiles
  e.g.:  do_mft -N2 -G -T *Z
  -Nnumberperpage  (default 10) number of file menu items per page
        this option is useful when using a slow connection since writing 
        a complete menu takes time
  -G              (default off) The default dispersion file name is of the form 
        StationComponent.dsp, e.g., SLMBHZ.dsp 
        When working with ground-noise cross-correlation for inter-station Green functions, the
        naming is Station1Component1Station2Component2.dsp , e.g., SLMBHZFVMBHZ.dsp
  -T              (default off)  run script MFTDOOVERLAY
  -11MIN min11 
  -11MAX max11 
  -DMIN  dmin 
  -DMAX  dmax 
   These options control the selection of the files for MFT
   analysis. The first two use the number in the IHDR11 field,
   which is the number of waveforms stacked for cross-correlation 
   of ground noise. The last two select the distances 
  -IG             (default false)  Inter-station phase velocity from cross-correlation 
  -h              (default false)  Usage 
</pre>
    <p> Some of these options are useful when working with the
      cross-correlation of ground noise. If there are N stations, then
      there are N(N-1)/2 station pairs. When working with TA data, the
      number of station pairs is huge for manual analysis using <b>do_mft</b>.
      The <i>-DMIN</i> and <i>-DMAX</i> flags permit the selection of
      a range of distances. The IHDR11 field is created by the <b>gsac</b>
      <i>stack</i> command set this parameter with the number of traces
      stacked. The chances of a useful cross-correlation should be
      better if the number of traces stacked is larger. </p>
    <p> The <i>-T</i> option permits the display of the <i>Tomo</i>
      buttons of <b>do_mft</b>. On pressing these buttons, the scripts
      MFTDOOVERLAY or PHVDOOVERLAY are executed. </p>
    <p> The <i>-IG</i> option permits the interactive phase velocity
      analysis. </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    Before running this example, go to the example directory:<br>
    <br>
    <pre>cd EMPIRICAL_GREEN/DIST/EXAMPLE1<br><br></pre>
    Now create the eigenfunctions which are used to provide the
    theoretical dispersion curves:<br>
    <br>
    <pre>DOSRF<br></pre>
    Start the example by entering <br>
    <pre>do_mft -G -IG -T *.WSTK
</pre>
    <p> The processing example follows: </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win01.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Place the mouse cursor on the trace of interest, and click. You
      will then see the next page.<br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win02.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Click on "Units" to select the physical units of the trace.&nbsp;
      For quantitative studies using spectral amplitudes, e.g., to
      determine earthquake source parameters, the proper physical unit
      must be used.&nbsp; For my source inversion processing, the traces
      always represent ground motion in <i>m/sec</i>.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>When working with empirical Green's functions from noise
      cross-correlation, select "Counts" as the unit.&nbsp; For such
      studies we are interested in the dispersion and not the spectral
      amplitude.<br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win03.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>After clicking on the "Do MFT" at the top of the page, we get a
      page for specifying parameters for the program <b>sacmft96</b>
      which does the work. Recall that the purpose of <b>do_mft</b> is
      to graphically select the output from <b>sacmft</b>. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In this menu, I have have selected the period range of 1.0 to
      50.0 seconds and identified the wave type as "Rayleigh" by
      clicking on the buttons and selecting a value. The "PhvPeak" menu
      item appears only because of the "-IG" flag used when starting <b>do_mft</b>.&nbsp;


      Clicking on "PhvPeak" will either give the message "1st" or "1st
      &amp; 2nd".&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of this is the following.&nbsp; The multiple filter
      analysis consists of applying a narrow band pass filter to the
      waveform.&nbsp; Up to 10 envelope peaks are determined.&nbsp; This
      may be useful to follow a mode in the presence of other
      signal.&nbsp; However since each envelope peak can be used to
      estimate a phase velocity, and because each phase velocity
      estimate has other possible values because of the N2&#960; phase
      ambiguity, the phase velocity display can be very cluttered and
      difficult to use. To keep that clean, and assuming that the
      larger spectral amplitudes (envelope peak values) will have better
      determined phase velocities, this menu restricts output to the
      largest or largest two envelope peaks.<br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win04.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Upon clicking on "DoMFT", the program <b>sacmft96</b> is run,
      and the following display is shown. At the bottom of that display
      will be a button "Tomo" because of the "-T" flag when <b>do_mft</b>
      was started.&nbsp; On clicking "Tomo" , a dispersion curve in
      white (note this only works when the background is shaded) is
      displayed and the "Tomo" button is removed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This path between two stations of the Saint Louis University
      component of the New Madrid Seismic Network (NM) goes through part
      of the Illinois Basin which has deep sections of&nbsp; Paleozoic
      strata.<br>
      This is the reason that the observed dispersion at short periods
      lies beneath the model prediction. <br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win05.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>If we now click the "PhVel" button a new image appears.&nbsp; The
      group velocity overlay picture is reproduced from the previous
      display. If we again click the "Tomo" button, the model predicted
      phase velocities are displayed together with the possible phase
      velocities. The "Tomo" button is now displayed.&nbsp; The purpose
      of the overlay is to use the prior knowledge of the predicted
      curve, which is based on a reasonable velocity model for the area,
      to resolve the N2&#960; phase ambiguity.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Autofeed" is set the processing state, so that the 2nd and 3rd
      menus do not appear. This assumes that one is comfortable with the
      processing parameters. The effect is that fewer mouse movements
      and clicks are required. This is very important when processing
      many, many waveforms.<br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win06.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Now click on "Auto" which brings up a menu to define the mode.<br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win07.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>After the mode is selected, the top of the figure will display
      the parameters.&nbsp; "Auto Picking" means that a rubber band can
      be used to select a group of points closest to the line. <br>
      The selected points are plotted in red in the next figure. As
      phase velocity values are selected, the corresponding group
      velocity values are highlighted. This provides confidence that the
      proper mode is selected.<br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win08.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>One can also use the "Zoom" buttom&nbsp; to focus in on part of
      the plot.&nbsp; Click on "Zoom" and then click on a point&nbsp; in
      the right figure and move the mouse. You will see a box open.
      Click again and the region will be expanded.&nbsp; You will also
      see the selected points.&nbsp; You can now select a few more, here
      shown in red.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When done selecting, click "Exit"&nbsp; you will asked whether to
      save the picks. You do not have to save the picks if you do not
      believe them.&nbsp; In this case we will save them. The file
      created used the original file name and appends a .phv, e.g.,
      SIUCBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK.phv to identify the phase velocity
      selection.&nbsp; The use of the file name occurs because the "-G"
      flag is used in invoking <b>do_mft.</b><br>
    </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win10.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>You are now returned to to the group velocity selection page. We
      again use the "Auto" command, identify the "Fund" mode, and select
      the dispersion. The corresponding spectral amplitudes are colored.
      For earthquake studies, the shape of the amplitude spectrum has
      some theoretical expectations as a function of period. This
      knowledge can be used to define the range of acceptable periods.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On clicking the "Exit" the user is asked whether to save the
      results in the file SIUCBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK.dsp. We will respond "Yes"
      to this question.&nbsp; The control returns to the first page
      display that lists the file names. </p>
    <p> <img src="FIGURES/Win11.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Since this discussion focused on the dispersion estimates, there
      was no discussion of the "Match" button which uses the group
      velocity picks to phase match filter the seismogram to isolate a
      mode.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Output formats</h2>
    <p>The two files SIUBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK.dsp and SIUCBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK.phv
      are very similar. Both have many columns. The group velocity output
      is identified by the initial MFT96 and the phase velocity by the
      initial PHV96.&nbsp; The SIUCBHZBLOBHZ.WSTK.phv file has three
      additional columns<br>

    The purpose of this length format is to provide spectral amplitudes,

    to provide information for surface-wave tomography, e.g., the
    dispersion value and the coordinates of the source and receiver, and
    finally<br>
    dispersion values for use with <b>surf96</b> or <b>joint96 </b>or
