    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The determination of earthquake source parameters through moment
    tensor inversion is a non-linear problem that is affected by many
    factors which may not be well understood. In the opinion of this
    author, the association of error to the source parameters may be
    impossible.
    <p> The factors affecting the inversion result are many and include
      the following:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Earth structure along the path between the source and the
        seismic station</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>The objective of the codes for determining source
      parameters is to model the observed waveforms through a
      theoretical wave propagation model. The simplest assumption is to
      assume a single, simple wave propagation model to all observation
      points. This assumption is never correct, but will be adequate if
      the focus is on modeling&nbsp; the lower frequency content in the
      observed waveforms. As one uses higher frequencies, the inability
      to model 3-D wave propagation, because of the synthetic seismogram
      codes used and the assumptions about the Earth model, affect the
      inversion.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Shallow structure beneath the seismic station</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>Even if the path is relatively simple,&nbsp; a site
      response may affect the levels of recorded motion.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Seismic instrumentation</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>Recorded data are noisy because of inherent instrumental
      noise and installation of the instrument.&nbsp; Such noise can be
      documented and perhaps mitigated through the selection of the
      instrumentation and care in installation.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Earth noise</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>This noise arises through human activity and natural
      processes related often to atmospheric effects. These noise levels
      dynamically change on time scales varying from hours, for human
      activity, to months, for seasonal changes.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>The distribution of observations<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>The actual observations depend on the source depth and
      source process. &nbsp; One can easily think of distributions of
      stations whose observations in the presence of noise provide no
      information for a particular source mechanism. <br>
    </blockquote>
    The purpose of this tutorial is to&nbsp; examine the effect of noise
    on source inversion results and&nbsp; to determine if goodness of
    fit parameters can be modeled in a synthetic study. This tutorial
    will consider a small earthquake in Arkansas, <a
      href="20130522171939/HTML.REG/index.html">Earthquake of May 22,
      2013</a>.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Another aspect of this example is that the ability of determining
    source parameters as a function of source size may be useful in
    defining the&nbsp;&nbsp; capabilities of a seismic network.<br>
    <h2>Modeling noise</h2>
    <p>The new tool developed for this study is the program <b>sacnoise</b>.
      Using the USGS Albuquerque Seismc Lab New Low Noise Model (NLNM)
      and New High Noise Model (NHNM), an acceleration<br>
      history in units of&nbsp; meters/s/s (M/S**2) is created as a sac
      file.&nbsp; The source code and Makefile are given in this
      distribution in MT_SENSITIVITY/src.&nbsp; The current command
      syntax is obtained by running the program using the <b>-h </b>flag:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>rbh&gt; sacnoise -h<br>Usage: sacnoise -pval pval -seed seed -dt dt -npts npts <br>  Create time series of noise based on ASL NLNM and NHNM models. The output has units of <br>     m/s**2   (default)<br>  The noise level can be adjusted between the low and high noise models with pval<br>     pval=1   High noise model<br>     pval=0.5 mid-noise model<br>     pval=0   Low  noise model<br> -dt   dt     (default 1.0) sample interval <br> -npts npts   (default 32768) length of time series <br> -pval pval   (default 0.5) <br> -seed seed   (default 12345) Integer random number seed <br> -h           (default false) online helpjk<br><br></pre>
    </blockquote>
    To illustrate the usage and&nbsp; the use of the <i>pval</i>
    parameter, the script <b>DOIT </b>in MT_SENSITIVITY/NOISEPLOTS/
    does the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates 100000 sample long random accelerations for a 0.1 s
        sample interval using different random number seeds for <i>pval
          = 0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 1.0.</i> The output of
        simulation&nbsp; is in the file <i>O.sac</i>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>For each sac file,&nbsp; the program <b>sacpsd</b> is used to
        compute the power spectrum with tabular output in files named as
        0.3.psd, for example.</li>
      <li>Finally, all PSD estimates are plotted together using another
        invocation of <b>sacpsd</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    The plot so created is<br>
    <br>
    <table width="50%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

        <tr align="center">

        </tr>
      </tbody>

    This figure illustrates the use of the <i>pval </i>parameter.&nbsp;



    The fact that the simulations for <i>pval=0.0</i> and <i>1.0</i>
    do not lie&nbsp; exactly on the NLNM and NHNM curves is because only
    one short simulation was performed. To perform realistic modeling,
    it would be useful to use <b>sacpsd</b> to determine actual noise
    PSD for stations in a network to guide the choice of the <i>pval</i>.
    It might also be useful to extend the program to read an actual
    noise power spectrum for the generation of simulation.<br>

    <p>The first simulation uses the Mw determined for the
      earthquake.&nbsp; The next two vary the Mw. The reason is that we
      might expect better results for a larger Mw which will provide
      greater signal-to-noise than for the smaller event.&nbsp; The last
      three simulations increase the noise level in another examination
      of the lower limit of applicability of the source inversion.&nbsp;
      The selected solution for each simulation is given in the files
      with names such as
      CUS.85.70.-20.0020.3,38.0.3/HTML.REG/fmdfit.dat.&nbsp; <br>

    <p>We see that the goodness of fit in the simulations depends on the
      event magnitude, with larger magnitudes giving a better fit,
      because the increased signal-to-noise ratio. As noise is
      increased, the fit degrades. &nbsp; Some figures from the detailed
      presentation of the processing results may help put the results in
      perspective. We will first compare the goodness of fit plots for
      the real data set and the first three simulations.<br>

    <p>This figure presents the goodness of fit&nbsp; (1.0 is the best
      fit)&nbsp; as a function of source depth and displays the focal
      mechanism for the best fit at each depth.&nbsp; First note that
      the data set for the actual event did not have a well defined best
      fit. The selected source depth of 2 km is very subtle. The
      fundamental question is&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the source depth and
      fault parameters are actually known.&nbsp; The simulation also
      uses more vertical and radial traces than the real data set.&nbsp;
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Interestingly Fig 2b, which is based on synthetics shows a very
      similar pattern of best fit as a function of depth.&nbsp; In this
      case the solution is known, which provides the basis for
      determining if the solution is correct.&nbsp; If the event had
      been smaller, e.g., Mw=3.0, Fig 2c shows that the fit degrades
      because of the lower signal-to-noise ratio. The simulation does
      provide a good estimate of the Mw.&nbsp; Finally, if the event had
      been larger, Fig 2d, there would have been better control on the
      depth.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In comparing Fig2b to Fig2d, it seems as if the pattern would be
      similar if the fit is plotted logarithmically. This is based on
      the ratio of the best fit value at the 2 km depth&nbsp; to the
      lower value at a 50 km depth.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To see the effect of noise consider the waveforms for the
      pval=0.4 simulations:<br>

    <p>Figure 3 compares the waveforms to be modeled (red) to the
      predicted best fit (blue). The time shift for best fit and
      reduction in variance are indicated to the right of each trace and
      the peak filtered velocity (0.02 - 0.10 Hz) is indicated at the
      left.&nbsp; The actual source inversion used at window width of
      only 75 seconds whereas the simulation used a window of 270
      seconds as a test of the superposition of noise and the clean
      synthetic.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In comparing the the fits to the observed data to those of the
      Mw=3.38 pval=0.3 simulations. a similar pattern is seen.&nbsp; For
      the actual data, many traces were judged too noisy for the source
      inversion. These were typically the Z and R traces at the larger
      distances. The simulations indicate that the analyst required a
      S/N of at least 2 or greater before judging a trace useful.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it may be possible to change the grid search used by <b>wvfgrd96


      </b>from a single pass to a two-pass process. The second pass
      would examine the fit to each trace and then automatically
      down-weight or reject a trace if the fit is less than 20%, or
      so.&nbsp; The effect of the time window on the fit parameter would
      have to be investigated.<br>

    After unpacking,<br>
    <pre>cd MT_SENSITIVITY/src<br>make<br><br></pre>
    This will compile the program <b>sacnoise</b>. You can then cd
