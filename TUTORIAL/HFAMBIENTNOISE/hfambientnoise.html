<header><h1>Computer Programs in Seismology Tutorial</h1> <h2>Simulate ambient noise processsing</h2></header>
    <h2 class="western">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this tutorial is to generate surface-wave noise
      for a known 1-D structural model by applying randomly oriented
      point sources at the surface of the structure and then propagating
      the 3-D ground motion to two receivers. The ground motions consist
      of multimode Rayleigh and Love waves.</p>
    <p>After generating a realistic noise sequence of 900 seconds length
      with a sampling interval of 0.002 sec, these noise segments are
      then cross-correlated and stacked to form the empirical Green’s
      function. The noise generation is done by the DOITHF script and
      the cross-correlation and stacking by the DOSTKZNE script.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This tutorial is set up to emulate real data acquisition. The
      total record of 900 sec at 0.002 sec sampling and receivers 100
      meters apart&nbsp; is reasonable for a field study.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Caution</h2>
    <p>Many details of processing to determine the empirical Greens
      functions by cross-correlation have been simplified. For real data
      I have only applied a frequency domain whitening before
      cross-correlation. Since tis simulation assumes noise sources
      equally spaced in origin time, the records may be very spiky. I
      had no luck with these simulations. However, if I applied a AGC to
      the cross-correlation time series before stacking, then I got
      something that gave acceptable results for analysis using <b>do_mft.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The value of these scripts is that then be modified through the
      use of different velocity models or different distances between
      the two receivers.&nbsp; As the seapration distance is made
      smaller, I would expect that it will be difficult to get
      dispersion data at the longer periods. There may also be a problem
      with the many modes arriving, so that a dispersion mode may not be
      able to be identified.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The other caution is that this script is set up to emulate a high frequency data acquisition where cartesian coordinates are appropriate. Anotehr script will have to be written to emulate data sets for stations widely separated, e.g., the TArray of USArray, where geocentric coodrinates have to be used.

      As set up, the DOITHF will generate 900 sec of noise for each of
      two stations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The script DOITHF is built on the DOITHVHF described under other
      tutorials. The only difference is that the creation of the
      synthetic is placed into a function, and noise is simulated at two
      stations. The output files have names such as 1.010101.Z and
      2.010101.Z&nbsp; which are the vertical component noise
      simulations for stations 1 and 2, respectively for time segment
      010101.&nbsp; All segments are then stacked to form the 900 second
      long noise waveform 1.Z.stk and 2.Z.stk<br>

    <p>As set up, this script processes each of the 900 seconds of
      continuous 3-component noise at the two stations in 10 second
      segments. Each segment is whitened int he frequency domain and
      amplitude adjusted usg an AGC operator. Then the 10 second
      segments are cross-correlated. After all of the noise is
      processed, the cross-correlations and reversed cross-correlations
      are saved, and stacked to form the interstation Green's
      functions&nbsp; Z.correv, N.correv and E.correv.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Because the stations were aligned in the EW direction, The
      Z.correv will have the Rayleigh wave, the E.correv will have the
      Rayleigh wave and the N.correv will have the&nbsp; Love wave
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      These were processed using the command<br>
    </p>
      <pre><b>do_mft -G -IG ?.correv</b><br></pre>
    <p>The -G ensures that the selected dispersion files will be named
      Z.correv.dsp&nbsp; for the ground velocities and Z.correc.phv for
      the phase velocities if the Z.correv is processed. The -IG flag<br>
      indicates that these are empirical Green's functions which permits
      the determination of phase velocities from the waveforms.</p>
    <p>Recall that<b> do_mft</b> invokes the programs <b>sacmft96 </b>to

      process the waveform. Besides creating a data file of possible
      dispersion values and a figure, the scripts <b>MFT96CMP</b> and <b>PHV96CMP</b>
      are<br>
      created to permit the plot of theoretical dispersion on top of the
