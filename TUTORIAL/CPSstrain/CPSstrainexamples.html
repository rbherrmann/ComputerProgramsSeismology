<header><h1>Computer Programs in Seismology Tutorial</h1> <h2>Stress-strain examples</h2></header>
<h1>Test</h1>
<p>
The example code is in the file <a href="CPSstrainexample.tgz">CPSstrainexample.tgz</a>. First you must compile a program that is not in the Computer Programs in Seismology distribution: <b>psac</b>. This is a utility for plotting Sac files. First define a SHELL variable <b>CPS</b> that points to the location of the Computer Programs in Seismology package, such as
</p><p>
<pre>
export CPS='/Users/rbh/PROGRAMS.310t/PROGRAMS.330/'
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Then to execute this test case, do the following:
<pre>
gunzip -f CPSstrainexample.tgz | tar xvf -
cd CPSstrain.example
make psac

DOIT
DOCLEANUP
</pre>
</p>
<p>The result of these computations will be the PNG files shown below: F14_5.png and F14_6.png.</p>
<p>the script <b>DOIT</b> invokes the scripts <b>DOITWK</b>, <b>DOSTRAIN</b>, <b>DOPLTF14_5</b> and <b>DOPTLF14_6</b> to do the following:
<ul>
<li><b>DOIT</b>: Top level script that invokes the other scripts, computes displacement and strain for different Cartesian system orientations, and converts the EPS files to PNG.</li>
<li><b>DOITWK</b>: Runs the programs <b>hprep96</b> and <b>hspec96strain</b> to make synthetics for the CUS model 
at a distance of 200 km with source depth of 2.0 km and receiver depth of 0.0 km. The sample interval is 0.25s.</li>
<li><b>DOSTRAIN</b>: Create the time histories in Sac format for a source with duration of 2.0s. The source mechanism has strike of 0&deg;, dip 90&deg;, rake of 0&deg; and Mw=2.6 (which corresponds to a moment of 1.0 x 10<sup>20</sup> dyne-cm. The observation azimuth is 45&deg;</li>
<li><b>DOPLT14_5</b>: Compare the ground velocities and rotations at the receiver in terms of the cylindrical coordinate system.</li>
<li><b>DOPLT14_6</b>: Compare the u<sub>1</sub> and e<sub>11</sub> derived from the cylindrical values. This illustrates what might be seen if a single component horizontal sensor and a horizontal strainmeter has arbitrary orientations at the receiver point.</li>
<li><b>DOCLEANUP</b>: Remove all files created by the scripts. But keep the scripts and the PNG images.</li>
</ul>

Comparison of ground velocities (maximum value is 1.8 x 10<sup>-7</sup> m/s) and rotations 
(maximum value is 2.6 x 10<sup>-11</sup>). As expected from plane wave simulations the u<sub>&phi;</sub> velocity is similar to the &omega;<sub>&phi;</sub> rotation. Also the u<sub>z</sub> velocity is similar to the &omega;<sub>rz</sub> rotation.
Plane wave theory show that the ratios are proportional to the phase velocity.

In this presentation, the velocity with maximum of 1.8 x 10 <sup>-7</sup> m/s is in the left column and the strain with maximum value of 2.5 x 10<sup>-11</sup> is on the right column. The local coordinate system is rotated through angles of 0&deg; to 340&deg; with respect to the radial direction form the source. Since the signal is a mixture of Love and Rayleigh waves, the presentation shows the different radiation patterns of each.
