	<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a short introduction to the use of the program <b>slat2d96</b>.
This implements the work of Keilis-Borok and others so model fundamental mode surface waves as they propagate through  larerally varying medium. This only works for the fundamental mode, and assumes conservation of energy.
<P>
The tutorial consists of a pdf file <a href="gChap4.pdf">gChap4.pdf</a> which describes the method. There is also gzip'd tar file that does the computations shown in the pdf file (<a href="ocean-continent.tgz">ocean-continent.tgz</a>). Unpack the archive using the commands:
<br>
<pre>
      gunzip -c ocean-continent.tgz | tar xvf -
