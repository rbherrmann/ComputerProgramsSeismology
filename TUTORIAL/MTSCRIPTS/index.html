    <p>Moment tensor solutions for earthquakes in North America are
      routinely determined by Saint Louis University using the codes
      distributed&nbsp;<a href="/eqc/eqccps.html"> Computer Programs in
        Seismology</a>. The basic codes are then invoked using&nbsp; a
      sequence of shell scripts that acquire the waveforms, remove the
      instrument response, permit an interactive quality control of
      ground motions, invert for the source and document the processing
      and results in detail.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this document is to provide the scripts, describe
      their function, and provide detail on how they can be modified for
      a local use. The result will be a web page such as <a
href="https://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqc_mt/MECH.NA/20220219003853/index.html">https://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqc_mt/MECH.NA/20220219003853/index.html</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This tutorial updates the scripts given in <a
        href="/eqc/eqc_cps/TUTORIAL/RMT">Regional Moment Tensor
        Inversion</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Because the scripts are designed to support routine moment tensor
      inversion in a region, the scripts are connected in the sense that
      a master script invokes supporting scripts after first setting
      parameters for the supporting scripts. </p>
    <p>These <b>bash</b> shell scripts are internally documented with
      comments and function well.&nbsp; Although one can create GUI's
      for processing, the value of these scripts is that they define the
      logical steps for processing.&nbsp; Many of the concepts have been
      incorporated into other systems.</p>
    <h2 class="western">Requirements</h2>
    <p>In order to perform moment tensor inversion, it is necessary that
      the current distribution of&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
        href="/eqc/eqccps.html">Computer Programs in Seismology</a>
      (CPS) be compiled and that the PATH variable be modified to point
      to the executables.&nbsp; In addition two environment parameters
      are used to point to the CPS directory and to the Green's
      functions directory. Since I use the <b>bash</b> shell on LINUX
      and MacOS, I have the following in the <i>.profile</i> file which
      is read upon login:</p>
    <pre style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>LINUX example 1</b>
<i>In ~/.profile</i>
# set PATH so it includes user's PROGRAMS.330/bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/PROGRAMS.330/bin" ] ; then
    PATH=":.:$HOME/PROGRAMS.330/bin:$PATH"
fi
<i>In ~/.bashrc</i>
export CPS=${HOME}/PROGRAMS.330
export GREENDIR=/media/sf_rbh/PROGRAMS.310t/GREEN
------------------------
<b>LINUX example 2</b>
<i>In ~/.profile</i>
PATH=:.:$HOME/bin:$PATH:$HOME/PROGRAMS.310t/PROGRAMS.330/bin:
<i>In ~/.bashrc</i>
export GREENDIR='/d/rbh/GREEN'
export CPS='/home/rbh/PROGRAMS.310t/PROGRAMS.330/'
------------------------
<b>OSX example</b>
<i>In ~/.profile</i>
OPATH=$PATH
PATH=:.:$HOME/bin:$HOME/PROGRAMS.310t/PROGRAMS.330/bin:$OPATH
export GREENDIR=${HOME}/PROGRAMS.310t/GREEN
export CPS=${HOME}/PROGRAMS.310t/PROGRAMS.330
 </pre>
    <p> If everything is set up correctly, then the shell will be able
      to find the executables and also be able to access the directory
      contents:</p>
    <b> </b>
    <pre style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>$ which gsac</b>
/home/cps/PROGRAMS.330/bin/gsac
$ ls -F $CPS
bin/      C.proto*              DOC/      readline-8.1/  VOLII/   VOLV/     VOLX/
C*        CPSInstall.pdf        include/  Setup*         VOLIII/  VOLVI/    XVIG/

<b>$ ls -F $GREENDIR</b>
CUS.REG/  Models/               WUS.REG/</pre>
    <p> Here the variable CPS is the location of the CPS software
      distribution while the variable GREENDIR is the location of the
      Green's functions required for inversion. These can be anywhere on
      the disk system, but they must exist.</p>
    <h2 class="western">Support software</h2>
    <p>In the distribution where will be a <b>src </b>directory that
      contains some utility programs for computing ML and mLg magnitudes
      from the data. These are provided since these are usful parameters
      to define the size of an earthquake. They really are part of the
      package because of a research interest in the relationship between
      a local magnitude and Mw. It will be necessary to compile these. </p>
    <p>In addition the scripts make use of the <b>convert</b> program
      of the ImageMagick package to convert EPS graphics to PNG for
      inclusion in the web page created.</p>
    <p>Finally, the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are use to make some
      maps</p>
    <h2 class="western">Distribution</h2>
    <p>All of the scripts are included in the file <a href="MECH.tgz">MECH.tgz</a>&nbsp;

        <p>To do this use the <b>python</b> <i>pip</i> command which may have to be installed. On LINUX Mint one would
fist install <i>pip</i> (<a href="tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux">tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux</a> a)s

<pre>
Install PIP On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:

# apt install python-pip	#python 2
# apt install python3-pip	#python 3
</pre>
The link gives the commands for other LINUX distributions. Next install the FDSN scripts from
<a href="pypi.org/project/fdsnwsscripts/">pypi.org/project/fdsnwsscripts</a>:
<pre>
pip oinstall fdsnwsscripts
</pre>
The installation will place the scripts into the <i>${HOME}/.local/bin</i> directory and warn is this is not in the <i>$PATH</i>  If not than place the following line in the <b>bash</b> <i>.profile</i> file:
<pre>
# set PATH to include the .local/bin directory
export PATH="$HOME/.local.bin"
</pre>
<p>
Note that Version 2022.17 <b>fdsnws2seed</b> will create a SEED volume which can be used with <b>rdseed</b> but  also creates Sac files and Sac pole-zero files.

    <h2 class="western">MECH</h2>
    <p>The MECH directory provides the required scripts and prototype
      organization.&nbsp; In my usage, there are similar directories
      that focus on different geographical reqions. For example I have
      the organization</p>
    <pre style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in">MOMENT_TENSOR
    |
    |----- MECH.NA     <font color="#ff0000"><b>[Moment tensor inversion for earthquakes in North America]</b></font>

    |
    |----- MECH.EU<font color="#ff0000">     </font><font color="#ff0000"><b>[Moment tensor inversion for earthquakes in other locations in Europe]</b></font></pre>
    <p> Thus the MECH directory is a prototype for any region.</p>

    <h2 class="western">Source Inversion</h2>
    <p>Typical source inversion requires broadband waveform data for a
      given event.&nbsp; Thus the process starts by specifying the event
      coordinates. In an automated or GUI based system this information
      would be provided by the system.&nbsp; For command line inversion,
      one must edit an initial file, here called <b>DO</b>, which looks
      like the following:</p>

    <p> In this script 15 variables must be specified.&nbsp; These are
      the year, month, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond of the
      event origina time. The event latitude, longitude and depth. The
      event magnitude. The region which is used to select the particular
      velocity model used to create the Green's functions. Finally there
      are 3 entries that are used to annotate the final documentation.</p>
    <p>Note that the&nbsp; lines are very similar. They differ only in
      the first command DOCWB, DOWS and DOWSF, etc. These scripts are
      designed to work with different data sets, e.g., the USGS
      Continuous Wave buffer, waveform data deposited at IRIS and
      waveform data deposited at federated data centers.&nbsp; There is
      also a DOFDSN to obtain waveform data from GFZ. The DOCWB5, DOWS5
      and DOWSF5 perform the same functions, but use GMT v5 and greater
      rather than GMT4 or GMT3.</p>
    <p>These scripts do the following:</p>
    <blockquote>create a durectory for the event<br>
      create a subdirectory structure for the inversion<br>
      create a subdirectory structure for downloading waveforms,
      deconvolving and QC'ing the waveforms.<br>
      download the waveform and responses<br>
      deconvolve waveforms to make ground velocity in m/s<br>
      rotate the wave forms<br>
      perform interactive QC<br>
      perform the inversion<br>
      <br>
    </blockquote>
    THE SIMPLEST WAY TO SET UP THE DATA STRUCTURE FOR AN EVENT WITHOUT
    ACTUALLY DOWNLOADING WAVEFORMS IS TO RUN<br>
    <b>DOWS </b>or <b>DOWS5.&nbsp; </b>If the data are available by
    another method, place the sac files and the response files in the <i>EVENT/EVENT/Sac




    </i>directory. If the RESP file is available, then run IDOEVT in the
    parent directory. If the response is in terms of pole-zero files,
    modify the IDOEVT script to identify them and then to use the proper
    <b>gsac</b> syntax for deconvolution.<br>
    <p>The following links discuss each in detail. Note the differences
      between DOCWB and DOCWB5 are minor, and the minor differences are
      indicated.</p>

          manually to acquire the data and then runs the deconvolution,
          rotation, QC and finally the inversion. The reason for the
          DOFINISH script is to permit fine tuning. This is especially
          the case for acquiring GEOFON data using <b>fdsnws_fetch</b>
          which does not support a distance search. Instead of obtaining
          all waveform data, this DOFINISH is edited to select the

    <p><b>DOGRD</b> performs the grid search over a range of source
      depths. It used the supporting script <b>DOSTA</b> to find the
      Green's functions at the observation distance, and then filters
      both. The filtering corner frequencies can be changed by editing
      the <b>DOSTA </b>script. In addition a microseism band reject
      filter can be applied and the signal time window can be adjusted.<br>
      <b>DODELAY </b>uses the timeshifts required to fit the Green's
      functions to the observed data to estimate changes in event
      location. If there seems to be a large mislocation, perhaps the
      Green's function model is not correct or the event location should
      be reviewed.<br>
      <b>DOPLTSAC (DOPLTSAC5) </b>used the ImageMagick <b>convert</b>

      these are included in the event web page for&nbsp;
      completeness.&nbsp; The DOHTMLK can be hand edited to add
      additional information, such as relocation results.</p>

    <p>The event directory will also have the subdirectories MTGRD.REG,
      MTGRD.REG.DEV and MTGRD.REG.DC.&nbsp;&nbsp; These codes are based
      on a paper my Zhu and Ben-Zion<br>
      &nbsp;(Zhu, L., and Y. Ben-Zion (2013). Paramaterization of
      general&nbsp; seismic potency and moment tensors for source
      inversion of seismic wavefrom data, Geophys. J. Int. 194,
      839-843.&nbsp; doi: 10.1093/gji/ggt137) that describes how to
      perform a grid search for a full moment tensor.&nbsp; The DOMTGRD
      in MTGRD.REG searchs for all six moment tensor parameters. The
      DOMTGRD in MTGRD.REG.DEV executes <b>wvfmtgrd96 -DEV</b> to
      perform a search for the deviatoric moment tensor. Finally the
      DOMTGRD in MTGRD.REG.DC searches for the best double couple using
      the command <b>wvfmtgrd96 -DC.</b>&nbsp; The wvfmtgrd96 -DC is
      equivalent to the CPS wvfgrd96. The wvfmtgrd96 -DEV takes longer
      to run since the grid search is over four parameters. The
      wvfmtgrd96 searches over 5 parameters and take a very long while
      to run.</p>
    <p>Within each of these directories, the scripts are run int he

    <h2 class="western">FINE TUNING OF SCRIPTS</h2>
    <p>Moment tensor inversion requires&nbsp; good signal-to-noise
      ratios and a simple signal. Thus the frequency band and time
      window may have to be adjusted.<br>
      Other processing scripts may also need to be adjusted. The
      following discussion will discuss these scripts. The scripts for
      data acquisition, deconvolution and quality control will be
      discussed first. Then the scripts for moment tensor inversion will
      be discussed. Finally the scripts for creating the HTML
      documentation will be discussed last.&nbsp; To make this
      discussion easier to follow, the path name consisting of the
      origin time will be given. Thus the script location may be in the
      directories</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This directory contains the files for deconvolving waveforms,
        rotating them, selecting a range of distances and QC'ing the
        ground velocity traces. The scripts are in PROTO.CWB if
        DOCWB/DOCWB5 is used, PROTO.WS if DOWS, DOWS5, DOWSF or DOWSF5
        is used, and in PROTO.GEOFON if DOGEOFON or DOGEOFON5 is
        invoked.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>The CWBDOEVT/IDOEVT adds the event information in the SAC
        files and deconvolves to ground velocity. The resulting fields
        are places in the GOOD subdrectory.&nbsp; Both scripts will
        check to see if some header valeus are not defined, e.g., with
        values of -12345. Specifically the network KNETWK and location
        KHOLE codes are checked. If a -12345 is seen, the header value
        is repalced by a black. This will make the name of the ground
        velocity file easier to read and will also simplify later
        displays. CWBDOEVT assumes the use of a pole-zero file that
        describes the instrument response in NM/S which the IDOEVT
        assumes the existence of a RESP file which us used with <b>evalresp</b>
        to make files of the amplitude and pahse response as a function
        of frequency.<br>
      </li>
      <li>CWBDOROT/IDOROT resets the waveforms headers so that the O
        (origin time) offset is 0, computes the model predicted travel
        time to set the A, T0 and T1 headers. The amplitudes are checked
        to see of the maximum ground vleocity is between 1.0e-10 and 0.1
        m/s. If&nbsp; there responses are not correct, the maximum value
        will be greater than 0.1 m/s, which is unrealistic.&nbsp; Three
