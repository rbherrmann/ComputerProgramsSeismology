<header><h1>Computer Programs in Seismology Tutorial</h1> <h2>Epicenter determination</h2></header>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This tutorial shows how to locate the epicenter of a seismic
      event using <b>gsac</b>, <b>sac2eloc</b> and
      <b>elocate</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>Data preparation</h2>
    <p>The file <a href="event.tgz">event.tgz</a> contains the Sac
      waveform files used in this tutorial. Unpack the files
      with the command
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>gunzip -c event.tgz | tar xvf -
</pre>
   </p> <p>
    This will create the subdirectory <i>DAT</i> which contains the
    waveform files. You can check to see that the files have the station
    coordinates properly installed with the command
    <pre>gsac
GSAC&gt; rh *
GSAC&gt; lh stla stlo stel
GSAC&gt; q
</pre>
</p><p>
    Note that the <b>gsac</b> invokes the code and that the <i>GSAC&gt;</i>
    are the interactive prompts of the program.
    <p></p>
    <h2>Arrival picking using gsac</h2>
    <p>
      <b>gsac</b> is used to pick the arrival times which are then saved
      in the header of each sac file. One can use the <i>plotpk</i> or
      the shorthand <i>ppk</i> to enter the interactive mode and then
      use 'P' or 'S' commands to time a phase. While this is can be
      done, <b>gsac</b> has a GUI to make picking easier. One enters
      the command <i>ppk REG</i> to pick arrivals for local and
      regional events or <i>ppk TEL</i> for teleseisms. The GUI permits
      the use to set arrival weights, polarities, and phase name. The
      example here uses the GUI.

</p><p>
    The result of this sequence is the window
    <br>
    <br>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img witgh="800" src="Fig01.png" height="660"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    The cursor is an arrow outside of the traces and a crosshair within
    the trace subwindows.
    To reposition the trace use the <b>gsac</b> <i>ppk</i> options
    [GSAC&gt; help ppk].
    The "x x" will permit a selection of part of the trace, the "*" "."
    or the mouse wheel will change the amplitude of the trace, and a "+"
    or "-" will center the trace on the cursor point and zoom in or out,
    respectively. The first traces, e.g., for station PB01, do not seem
    to have a strong S. After entering "x" and moving the cursor and
    entering the second "x" and using the mouse wheel on the Z
    component, we get Figure 2:
    <br>
    <br>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img witgh="800" src="Fig02.png" height="660"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    Now the P arrival is obvious. To pick the arrival click on the "P"
    button, move the cursor to the trace and click on the aligned
    arrival. The "i" and "e" buttons appear - select "i" is this is a
    sharp arrival and "e" if it is emergent. This choice affects the
    arrival weight. After this select the polarity. "C" for a strong
    compression, usually up/positive on the vertical, "+" for a weak
    compression, "D" for a strong dilatation/down, "-" for a weak down,
    and "X" for an indeterminate first motions. The pick is now
    displayed. If you do not like it, hit the "Undo" button.
    <br>
    <br>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img witgh="800" src="Fig03.png" height="660"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    If you are finished with this trace, enter "n" to go to the next
    trace. If you
    want to back up to a previous trace, enter "b". For the next trace I
    picked the S on the HH1 channel and zoomed in on the P arrival on
    the HHZ trace and then increased the amplitude to see the small
    initial downward motions.
    <br>
    <br>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img witgh="800" src="Fig04.png" height="660"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    When you are done picking "q" from the interactive picking, or after
    looking a all traces, you will be returned tot he command prompt.
    Here you will save the picks using the "wh" / "writeheader" command.
    Do not use the "w" / "write" command since the original traces will
    be overwritten by the filtered traces that you used.

    <h2>sac2eloc</h2>
    <p>To locate the event, we need to place the arrival picks and other
      information into the file <i>elocate.dat</i>.</p>
    <p>To avoid cluttering the directory containing the sac files, we
      will work in the directory above. thus enter the command
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>sac2eloc DAT/*SAC  #[since the sac files ended as .SAC]
</pre>
</p><p>
    <br>
    The result is the file <a href="elocate.dat">elocate.dat</a>.
    <br>
    <h2>elocate</h2>
    <p>This program is described in Chapter 5of the&nbsp; <b>gsac</b>
      tutorial that is the file <i>cps330g.pdf</i> in the directory <i>PROGRAMS.330/DOC/GSAC.pdf</i>
      of the source distribution. <br>
    </p>
    <p><b>elocate</b> has some built in velocity models but Chapter 5
      discusses the format of the <i>VEL.MOD</i> file so that a user
      defined velocity model can be used.
    </p>
    <p>Since <b>elocate</b> is discussed in <i>cps330g.pdf</i>, the
      following will show the commands used to locate the event.
      The processing will be in the <i>batch</i>, e.g., non-interactive
      mode. The user is encouraged to run the program interactively to
      appreciate how the choice of the velocity model and initial source
      depth can affect the solution, since event location is a
      non-linear&nbsp; problem.
    </p>
    <p>If you first execute <b>elocate</b> you will be presented with
      the velocity models in the file <i>VEL.MOD</i>. The WUS model is
      identified as "7". So a batch run using the WUS model would be
      <br>
    </p>
<font size="2">
    <pre>
elocate -VELMOD       #[Creates the file VEL.MOD in the directory.]
elocate -M 7 -D 10 -BATCH &gt; elocate.txt   
<font color="#ff0000">#[Use model 7, an initial depth of 10 km and batch (automatic run.}</font>
</pre>
</font>
</p><p>
The output of this run is in the file <a href="elocate.txt">
        elocate.txt</a>. The first part of this file shows the data
      which includes the station, weight, arrival time,. phase and
      polarity, and station latitude, longitude and elevation [Note: <b>elocate</b>
      does not use elevation corrections]. The results of the iterations
      is next which gives latitude, longitude, depth, origin time, and
      RMS error. Obviously there is some observation that causes a big
      residual. After the maximum number of iterations is achieved or
      the solution converges, the fit to each phase is given. Here the P
      arrival at PB17 has a large residual, and that trace should be
      reexamined. Note that this was weighted 0.00 in the inversion
      because of the large residual. The final part, reproduced here is
      the solution:

    The fit is not good, mostly because the initial P amplitudes read
    were very small. The <b>elocate</b> solution gives the azimuth to
    the station and also the takeoff angle of the P way to the station.
    This angle is measured from the downward vertical. If the depth
    changes, or if a different model is used, the takeoff angle will
    change.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      I sometimes use <b>elocate</b> in the processing of regional
      moment tensors which the time shift between the observed and
      predicted waveforms indicates a mislocation. I also run this code
      then the moment tensor is not what was expected given its
      location. In this case I compare the moment tensor nodal planes
      and P (pressure) and T (tension) axes to P-wave first motions.
      Given perfect data sets and the correct regional velocity model,
      the moment tensor mechanism and depth should agree with observed
      p-wave first motions and hypocenter. This is the ideal validation
      of a solution.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you have an independent solution, with the event coordinates
      set in the SAC file headers, the traces can be rotated. Further
      theoretical arrival times for a model can be entered into the
      header given the distance and source depth in the header. Often I
      find that the S arrival is sharper on the T (transverse
      component), and thus read it from that component.<br>
