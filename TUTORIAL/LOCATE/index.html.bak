<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This tutorial shows how to locate the epicenter of a seismic event using <b>gsac</b>, <b>saceloc</b> and
<b>elocate</b>.
<h2>Data preparation</h2>
<p>The file <a href="event.tgz">event.tgz</a> contains the Sac waveform files used in this tutorial. Unpack the files
with the command
<br>
<pre>
gunzip -c event.tgz | tar xvf -
</pre>
<br>
This will create the subdirectory <i>Sac</i> which contains the waveforms files. You can check to see that the files have the station coordinates properly installed with the command
<br>
<pre>
gsac
GSAC> rh *
GSAC> lh stla stlo stel
GSAC> q
</pre>
<br> Note that the <b>gsac</b> invokes the code and that the <i>GSAC&gt;</i> are the interactive prompts of the program.
</p>
<h2>Arrival picking using gsac</h2>
<p>
<b>gsac</b> is used to pick the arrival times which are then saved in the header of each sac file. One can use the <i>plotpk</i> or the shorthand <i>ppk</i> to enter the interactive mode and then use 'P' or 'S' commands to time a phase. While this is can be done, <b>gsac</b> has a GUI to make picking easier. On can enter the command <i>ppk REG</i> to pick arrivals for local and regional events or <i>ppk TEL</i> for teleseisms. The GUI permits the use to set arrival weights, polarities, and phase name. The example here uses the GUI.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
cd DAT
gsac
GSAC> r *
GSAC> ppk regional
   ...      [the GUI appears]
   ...      [when done picking, save the picks in the header of each sac file]
GSAC> wh
GSAC> q
</pre>
</p>
<p>
For the data set the following shows the commands and interactive session:
<br>
<pre>
cd DAT
gsac
GSAC> r *
GSAC> rtr
GSAC> hp c 1 n 2
GSAC> lp c 3 n 2   [For regional events this is a good frequency band for picking]
GSAC> qdp 10       [To make the display faster, only display every 10th point.
                    This is permissible since we just did a low pass ]
GSAC> ppk perplot 3 regional
                   [Use the regional picking GUI and display three traces at 
                    a time since the stations have 3 components of motion]
</pre>
<br>
The result of this sequence is the window
<br>
<table> <tr><td><img height="660" witgh="800"  src="Fig01.png"></td></tr></table>
<br>
The cursoe is an arrow outside of the traces and a crosshair within the trace subwindows.
To reposition the trace use the <b>gsac</b> <i>ppk</i> options [GSAC> help ppk].
The "x x" will permit a selection of paret of the trace, the "*" "." or the mousewheel will change the amplitude of the trace, and a "+" or "-" will center the trace on the cursor point and zoom in or out, respectively. The first traces, e.g., for station PB01, do nto seem to have a strong S. After enterning "x" and moving the cursor and entering the second "x" and using the mousewheel on the Z component,  we  get Figure 2:
<br>
<table> <tr><td><img height="660" witgh="800"  src="Fig02.png"></td></tr></table>
<br>
Now the P arrival is obvious. To pick the arrival click on the "P" button, move the cursor to the trace and click on the aligned arrival. The "i" and "e" buttons appear - select "i" is this is a sharp arrival and "e" if it is emergent. This choice affects the arrival weight. After this select the polarity. "C" for a strong compression, usually up/positve ont he vertical, "+" for a weak compression, "D" for a strong dilatation/down, "-" for a weak down, and "X" for an indeterminate first motions. The pick is now displayed. If you do not like it, hit the "Undo" button.
<br>
<table> <tr><td><img height="660" witgh="800"  src="Fig03.png"></td></tr></table>
<br>
If you are finished with this trace, enter "n" to go to the nex trace. If you
want to back up to a previous trace, enter "b". For the next trace I picked the S on the HH1 channel amd zoomed in on the P arrival on the HHZ trace and then increased the amplitude to see the small initial downward motions.
<br>
<table> <tr><td><img height="660" witgh="800"  src="Fig04.png"></td></tr></table>
<br>
When you are done picking "q" from the interactive picking, or after looking a all traces, you will be returned tot he 
command prompt. Here you will save the picks using the "wh" / "writeheader" command. Do not use the "w" / "write" command since the original traces will be overwritten by the filtered traces that you used.
<br>

GSAC> q

</br>


<h2>sac2eloc</h2>
<p>To locate the event, we need to place the arrival picks and other information into the file <i>elocate.dat</i>.</p>
<p>To avoid cluttering the directory containing the sac files, we will work in the directory above. thus enter the command
<br>
<pre>
sac2eloc DAT/*SAC  [since the sac files ended as .SAC]
</pre>
<br>
The result is the file <a href="elocate.dat">elocate.dat</a>.
<br>

<h2>elocate</h2>
<p>This program is described in the <b>gsac</b> tutorial that is the file <i>cps330g.pdf</i> in the directory <i>PROGRAMS.330/DOC/GSAC.pdf</i> of the source distribution. The discussion of <b>elocate</b> is in Chapter 5 of this tutorial. 
</p>
<p><b>elocate</b> has some built in velocity models but Chapter 5 discusses the format of the <i>VEL.MOD</i> file so that a user defined velocity model can be used.
</p>
<p>Since <b>elocate</b> is discussed in <i>cps330g.pdf</i>, the following will show the commands used to locate the event.
The processing will be in the <i>batch</i>, e.g., non-interactive mode.  The user is encouraged to run the program interactively to appreciate how the choice of the velocity model and initial source depth can affect the solution, since event location is the result of a non-linear inversion.
</p>
<p>If you first execute <b>elocate</b> you will be presented with the velocity models in the file <i>VEL.MOD</i>. The WUS model is identified as "7". So a batch run using the WUS model would be
<br>
<pre>
elocate -VELMOD             [Creates the file VEL.MOD in the directory.]
elocate -M 7 -D 10 -BATCH > elocate.txt   
                            [Use model 7, an initial depth of 10 km and batch (automatic run.}
</pre>
<br>
</p>
<p>The output of this run is in the file <a href="elocate.txt"> elocate.txt</a>. The first paret of this fiule shows the data which includes the station, weight, arrival time,. phase and polarity, and station latitude, longitude and elevation [Note:a<b>elcoate</b> does not use elevation corrections]. The results of the interations is next which gives latitude, longitude, depth, origin time, and RMS error. Obviously there is some observatin that causes a big residual. After the maximum number of iterations is achieved or the solution converges, the fit to each phase is given. Here the P arrival at PB17 has a large residual, and that trace should be reexamined. Note that this was weighted 0.00 in the inversipon because of the large residual. The final part, reprodiced here is the solution:
<br>
<pre>
 Error Ellipse  X=   1.7949 km  Y= 2.7735 km  Theta = 348.0448 deg (azimuth of X axis)

 RMS Error        :               1.694              sec

    ch o gmt   2024 270  07 56 47 380
</pre>
<br>
The last three line are <b>gsac</b> commands if you wish to place the location information in the sac files, e.g.,
<br>
<pre>
gsac
GSAC> rh *SAC
GSAC>   ch evla    31.5325 evlo  -104.1199 evdp      12.90
GSAC>   ch ocal   2024 09 26 07 56 47 380
GSAC> wh
GSAC> q
</pre>
If the <i>CMPINC</i> and <i>CMPAZ</i> fields are set in the header, you are ready to rotate the three component traces to make Z, R and T traces.
</p>
<p>
Several output files are created: fmplot.tmp, assoc.tmp, origin.tmp. orger.tmp and elocate.sum. They contain information from the elcoate.txt listing. The <i>fmplot.tmp</i> can be use with the program <b>fmplot</b> to plot thje first motions. In this example, there is
a propsoed focal mechanism (solid curves) that is comapred to the observatiopns. The commands are
<br>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

elocate -VELMOD
elocate -M 7 -BATCH -D 10 > elocate.txt

# compar the first motion to this solution
STK=320
DIP=40
RAKE=-80

fmplot -S $STK -D $DIP -R $RAKE -F fmplot.tmp -tp
plotnps -BGFILL -F7 -W10 -EPS -K < FMPLOT.PLT > t.eps
# Use ImageMagick to convert EPS to PNG
convert -trim t.eps slufm.png
</pre>
<br>
The result is in the file <i>slufm.png</i>:
<br>
<table> <tr><td><img src="slufm.png"></td></tr></table>
</br> 
The fit is not good, mistly because the initial P amplitudes read were very small. The <b>elocate</b> solution gives the azimuth to the station and also the takeoff anble of the P way to the station. This angle is measured from the downward vertical. If the depth changes, or if a different model is used, the takeoff angle will change.
<p>


<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>
I sometimes use <b>elocate</b> in the processing of regional moment tensors which the time shift between the observed and predicted waveforms indicates a mislocation. I also run this code then the moment tensor is not what was expected given its location. In this case I compare the moment tensor nodal planes and P (pressure) and T (tension) axes to P-wave first motions. Given perfect data sets and the correct regional velocity model, the moment tensor mechanism and depth should egree with observed p-wave first motions and hypocenter. This is the ideal validation of a solution.
